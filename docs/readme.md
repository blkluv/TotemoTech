## TotemoTech

A podcast of the latest tech news from Japan, powered by AI with computer-generated voice.

[TotemoTech](https://totemotech.com) has been built using Jekyll and GitHub Pages to create individual posts for each episode and power the RSS feed for podcast subscriptions. 

Credit for the site design goes to [Tim Klapdor](https://timklapdor.com/). This site was inspired by Tim's use of the [Jekyll Skeleton](https://github.com/timklapdor/jekyll-skeleton) to create the [LinkRot Podcast](https://github.com/timklapdor/link-rot).
