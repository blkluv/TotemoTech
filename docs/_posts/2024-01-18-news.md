Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on January 18th, 2024. In today's news, NEC has partnered with the traditional bakery Kimuraya Sohonten to develop AI-powered steamed buns called 'Koi AI Pan.' Using AI analysis of conversations from dating shows and lyrics from songs featuring fruits and sweets, the AI created five flavors of buns, including 'Fateful Encounter' and 'Jealousy.' 

In other news, the University of Tokyo's Earthquake Research Institute has released photos showing the complete disappearance of the 'Kamogaura Saltwater Pool' due to the coastal uplift caused by the Noto Peninsula Earthquake in Reiwa 6.

In the business sector, Fujitsu's stock experienced a sharp drop of 4% on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on January 17th. This decline is believed to be a result of the fallout from the false accusation incident involving a British postal service provider, which was caused by a defect in Fujitsu's accounting system. A Fujitsu executive testified and apologized before the UK House of Commons committee on the 16th.

Lastly, in the education sector, there have been issues with the internet application system for public high school admissions in Kanagawa Prefecture.
