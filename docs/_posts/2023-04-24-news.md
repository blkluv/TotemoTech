### Transcript

Welcome to the TotemoTech podcast on April 24th, 2023. Today we have a variety of news stories to cover, ranging from AI decision-making to big data infrastructure and ransomware attacks.

First up, a survey has found that over 60% of companies in Japan want to rely on AI for decision-making, citing concerns about societal division. The survey also looks at the earnings from point-based rewards programs, or "poikatsu."

In other news, [LINE](/companies/line) has adopted Cloudera for its big data infrastructure, and the company's chief data officer explains why they chose Cloudera and their joint efforts.

Meanwhile, a company called SORACAME is using camera-based remote monitoring to make work sites easier to manage. We also take a look at kintone and the SI projects undertaken by Comchua, a company that has seen significant growth in this area.

Moving on to events, the AWS Summit Tokyo was held in person for the first time in four years, with a keynote speech focusing on AI and cloud usage in the public sector. And in the realm of cybersecurity, Palo Alto Networks has released a report on ransomware trends for 2023.

Finally, we have a personal piece from our own writer, Ohtani Ibisa, on his observations of the IT industry. And for those struggling with work-related issues, [NTT SmartConnect](/companies/ntt-smartconnect) has a cloud service called "wakucone" that aims to solve these problems.

And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
