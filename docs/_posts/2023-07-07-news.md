### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 7th, 2023. In today's news, Chinese researchers have proposed a method to deceive airport X-ray security scanners, while ByteDance and researchers from the University of Wisconsin have announced a framework to reconstruct 360-degree 3D head models from a single portrait photo.

First, let's talk about the research conducted by Chinese researchers from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics and Zhongguancun Laboratory. They have published a study proposing a technique to deceive airport X-ray security scanners. The researchers suggest that by placing a certain object in your bag, it can go undetected by the X-ray detection system. This raises concerns about potential security vulnerabilities in airport screening processes.

Moving on to ByteDance and the University of Wisconsin's collaboration, they have developed a framework to reconstruct 360-degree 3D head models from a single portrait photo. This innovative technology allows for the generation of a complete 3D model of a person's head, including the invisible back of the head, using just one photo. The framework could have various applications in fields such as virtual reality, gaming, and digital avatars.

Next, let's discuss an insightful analysis of AI and its impact. The TV anime series 'AI no Idenshi' has gained attention for its depiction of coexistence between humans and humanoids in a near-future SF setting. The author of the series, together with an AI specialist, engages in a continuous dialogue. In their first conversation, they delve into topics such as the winner of the 'AI Art Grand Prix' and the concept of digital copies of personalities. This conversation provides a fascinating glimpse into the world of AI and its potential future developments.

Shifting gears, we turn our attention to the new social networking service 'Threads' and its monetization strategy. Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, has stated that 'Threads' will not be inundated with advertisements in the near future. He mentioned that they will consider monetization only after ensuring the product reaches one billion users. This approach aims to prioritize user experience and engagement before implementing advertising.

Speaking of 'Threads,' the new social networking service has already surpassed 30 million registrations within just one day of its launch. Mark Zuckerberg expressed his excitement, stating that he has a feeling that something special is about to begin. 'Threads' is quickly emerging as a strong competitor to established platforms like Twitter.

In other news, glafit, a company specializing in electric mobility, has announced their plans to release electric bicycles, classified as 'specific small-sized motor-assisted bicycles,' for general sale in 2024. This move aims to differentiate electric bicycles from electric kick scooters and clarify their classification.

Finally, printing company Toppan Printing has developed an NFC tag label that can detect the remaining liquid volume inside bottles and containers using a capacitive sensor. This technology will be available globally from August and is expected to find applications in industries such as cosmetics, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and alcoholic beverages.

That's all for today's news from TotemoTech. Stay tuned for more updates on the latest tech developments.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
