Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on November 11th, 2023. In today's news, the latest flagship model of iRobot's Roomba series, the Roomba Combo J9+, has been released. This new model comes with several new features, including the ability to automatically refill its water tank. We had the opportunity to test the product and discuss its evolution in the field of robot vacuum cleaners.

Moving on to our next story, Google is hosting a Black Friday sale on its own e-commerce site, Google Store. Starting from November 17th, customers will be able to purchase the latest smartphone, the Google Pixel 8, and the smartwatch, Google Pixel Watch, at discounted prices. This sale is a great opportunity for tech enthusiasts to get their hands on these cutting-edge devices.

Next up, Cygames, a subsidiary of CyberAgent, has announced its plan to monitor and take legal action against cyberbullying and harassment towards players on ABEMA's Mahjong Channel. This move aims to create a safer and more respectful environment for the players, ensuring that they can enjoy their gaming experience without fear of online abuse.

Shifting gears, OpenAI has launched the official X account (@ChatGPTapp) for its AI chatbot, ChatGPT, on Twitter. This account will provide users with the latest updates and information about ChatGPT, allowing them to engage with the AI chatbot directly.

In other news, the cost of standardizing local government systems has become a topic of discussion. The government's initiative to standardize these systems has raised questions about who will bear the financial burden. Initially, Minister Kono stated that the government would cover all costs, but later clarified that the responsibility lies with the Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications. This clarification has sparked interest and debate regarding the funding of this standardization project.

Furthermore, BASE, a popular e-commerce platform, has announced a significant price increase for its paid plan. The monthly fee for the plan will be raised from 5,980 yen to 19,980 yen, more than triple the original price. This sudden and substantial increase has led to outcry from users, many of whom are considering switching to alternative services.

Lastly, a recent survey conducted by a private company revealed that around 70% of individuals in their 20s feel uncomfortable with phone calls, a phenomenon known as 'telephone phobia' or 'telephobia.' The widespread use of social media chat and messaging functions has resulted in a decrease in phone conversations, leading to increased anxiety and discomfort among young people when it comes to making or receiving phone calls. This survey sheds light on the changing communication preferences and challenges faced by the younger generation.
