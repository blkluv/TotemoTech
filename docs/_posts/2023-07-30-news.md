### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 30th, 2023. In today's news, the Sumidagawa Fireworks Festival, which hasn't been held for 4 years, is making a comeback. The festival organizers are also considering live streaming the event for those who prefer to enjoy it from the comfort of their own homes.

Moving on to gaming news, the highly anticipated game 'Pikmin 4' was released on July 21st. Fans and even manga artists are raving about the game's user-friendliness and the adorable character, Ochin.

Next, let's talk about AI technology. There's an AI system that can turn haiku poems into movies. When the phrase '蛙飛び込む水の音' (the sound of a frog jumping into water) was given to the AI, it surprisingly created a children's song instead. It's fascinating to see how AI interprets and transforms artistic expressions.

Shifting gears to telecommunications, NTT Docomo has announced improvements in network quality at four major stations in Tokyo. While the company claims that the measures they implemented have been effective, they have not disclosed the specific conditions under which the measurements were taken.

Lastly, an unfortunate incident involving the misuse of fax machines has been reported by the Okinawa Labor Bureau. Personal information was mistakenly sent to an unrelated individual due to an incorrect fax number. The use of fax machines for exchanging personal information is prohibited, making this incident a serious violation of privacy.

And that's all for today's news. Thank you for tuning in to TotemoTech. Stay tuned for more updates on the latest tech trends and news.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
