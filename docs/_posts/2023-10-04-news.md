Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on October 4th, 2023. In today's news, Adobe has officially launched the web version of 'Adobe Photoshop', which is now compatible with Google's 'Chromebook Plus'. The Chromebook Plus is a high-spec Chromebook that meets hardware requirements and can also execute AI functions. This compatibility allows users to access the powerful features of Photoshop on their Chromebook devices.

Moving on to our next story, King Jim has announced the release of a new product called 'Memamorin'. It is a device designed to help prevent myopia in children. Memamorin uses lights and buzzers to notify children when their faces are too close to screens. This innovative solution aims to reduce the risk of nearsightedness among young users.

Next up, we have an exciting space-related news story. The space startup ALE is calling for widespread observation as their demonstration satellite, 'ALE-1', is expected to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere soon. ALE has loaded ALE-1 with 400 pellets of 'meteor shower particles' to create artificial shooting stars. They are encouraging people to observe this unique event and enjoy the spectacle of shooting stars lighting up the night sky.

Switching gears to the world of cinema, Toho has announced a special screening of the monochrome version of the movie 'Shin Godzilla', titled 'Shin Godzilla: Orso'. This version of the film is a special project brought forward by director Hideaki Anno. The monochrome visuals offer a different viewing experience and convey a distinct artistic meaning.

In other news, Casio has partnered with VRChat, a virtual reality platform, to open a virtual store featuring their iconic 'G-SHOCK' watches. This collaboration aims to popularize the culture of avatars wearing wristwatches and create a virtual shopping experience for G-SHOCK enthusiasts.

Shifting our focus to the telecommunications sector, the Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has announced that Rakuten Mobile is the only company to have applied for the allocation of the 'Platinum Band' (700MHz band) for base station deployment. The application will undergo evaluation, and if approved, the matter will be referred to the Radio Regulatory Council for consultation on October 23rd. Rakuten Mobile is likely to secure the Platinum Band, allowing them to expand their network coverage.

And finally, an incident at Hamamatsu Johoku Technical High School in Shizuoka Prefecture has raised concerns about student privacy. Four iPads, provided to students, had access to individual teachers' Google Drives, exposing personal information such as student names and test scores. The school is taking measures to address this breach and ensure the protection of student data.
