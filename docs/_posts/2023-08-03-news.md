Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on August 3rd, 2023. Rakuten Mobile has introduced a beta version of its desktop app for voice calls and SMS messaging called 'Rakuten Link.' Users of Rakuten's 'Rakuten Strongest Plan' can now make and receive voice calls and send SMS messages directly from their PCs.

In other news, Binance Japan has launched a dedicated trading platform for residents in Japan. The platform supports 34 cryptocurrencies, including BNB. Binance Japan has started accepting user registrations for the new platform.

Moving on, SoftBank has announced a partnership with Microsoft Japan to accelerate the adoption of Microsoft's services. This includes the integration of Microsoft Azure cloud services and the introduction of services like 'Azure OpenAI Service,' which provides access to large-scale language models such as 'GPT-3.5.'

The Consumer Affairs Agency has ordered Banzan, an online tutoring service provider, to pay a fine of 63.46 million yen. The agency found that Banzan had falsely claimed to be the 'top-rated' service provider based on customer satisfaction, even though the survey included non-users.

In social media news, TweetDeck has rebranded itself as 'XPro.' While the name has changed, the functionality remains the same, and users can still switch back to the previous version from the settings menu.

In the world of manufacturing, Daikin, a leading air conditioning company, has announced the establishment of its first air conditioning equipment factory in the Kanto region. The company plans to invest approximately 20 billion yen to acquire land in Tsukuba Mirai City, Ibaraki Prefecture, for the new production facility.
