Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on September 18th, 2023. In today's news, DJI has unveiled the latest addition to their OSMO Action series, the OSMO Action 4. While it maintains a similar design and size to its predecessor, one notable improvement is the larger sensor, labeled as "1/1.3" on the lens. This upgrade is expected to enhance the overall usability of the camera.

Moving on to our next story, Blackmagic Design has introduced a new camera app called "Blackmagic Camera" for iPhone users. This free app offers a wide range of professional features, including support for 10-bit 4K ProRes. Now, iPhone users can access similar capabilities to those found in Blackmagic Design's dedicated video cameras.

Shifting gears, let's talk about the recent price increase for the "PS Plus" subscription service. Starting from September 6th, PlayStation Plus subscribers have experienced a significant price hike. This has sparked concerns among avid gamers and even manga artists who rely on the service. Many are now reconsidering their subscription plans and evaluating the value proposition of the updated service.

Next up, let's dive into the world of Japanese cuisine. Takara Tomy, known for their innovative toys, has collaborated with a professional chef to create the ultimate onigiri (rice ball). This new product promises to deliver fluffy and delicious onigiri, similar to those served in popular onigiri specialty stores across Japan. The unique techniques employed by the chef have impressed many, highlighting the growing popularity of onigiri and the demand for convenient ways to enjoy this traditional Japanese dish.

Turning our attention to sports, DAZN, a popular sports streaming platform, has achieved record-breaking viewership numbers with its live coverage of the Hanshin Tigers, a professional baseball team. The recent game that secured the Tigers' league championship became the most-watched baseball content on DAZN this season. This highlights the increasing popularity of streaming services for sports enthusiasts.

Now let's talk about something fun and creative. The "Emoji kitchen" feature, which allows users to mix two emojis and create unique combinations, is gaining attention on social media. Recently, Google expanded the availability of this feature, and users on the X platform (formerly known as Twitter) are having a blast creating and sharing chaotic emoji combinations. It's a lighthearted way to express oneself and add some humor to online conversations.

Lastly, let's explore some unique and quirky research studies that could potentially be candidates for the next Ig Nobel Prize. The Ig Nobel Prize, awarded for unusual and imaginative scientific achievements, has announced its winners for 2023. Among the notable contenders for future recognition are studies that recreate the sensation of insects crawling in the mouth using virtual reality, an AI system for diagnosing diarrhea, and a bag clip that emits belch sounds. These unconventional studies showcase the diverse and intriguing nature of scientific exploration.
