Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 4th, 2023. In today's news, KDDI, a Japanese telecommunications company, has announced that the satellite internet service 'Starlink' provided by SpaceX is now available in Japan's waters. Starting from July 3rd, KDDI will offer the high-speed internet service to maritime shipping companies, fishing associations, and cruise operators to meet their needs for fast connectivity.

In other news, the Nakano Sun Plaza, a multi-purpose facility located in front of JR Nakano Station, has closed its doors after 50 years of operation. The closure marks the end of an era for the venue, but plans are already underway for its revival in 2029, with the aim of preserving the unique atmosphere that made it popular among audiences.

Moving on, game publisher Yostar has announced the discontinuation of Twitter integration features in their smartphone games, including popular titles like 'Azur Lane' and 'Blue Archive.' The decision comes as a result of Twitter's API changes, game specification adjustments, and technical reasons.

Meanwhile, the limitations on accessing up-to-date information through social media platforms due to Twitter's API restrictions have led to a resurgence of interest in RSS feeds. Journalists who experienced the native Twitter era are now turning to RSS feeds as a reliable source of news updates.

In the world of anime, Bandai Namco Filmworks has revealed plans to produce a new anime series titled 'Mobile Suit Gundam: Requiem of Vengeance.' Utilizing the Unreal Engine 5, the series will depict the European front during the One Year War and consist of six episodes, each lasting 30 minutes. The anime will be available for worldwide streaming.

Shifting gears, Rakuten has introduced the 'Rakuten Strongest Plan' data-only SIM, which offers the same price as the SIM with voice call functionality. This new plan caters to users who primarily rely on data services and do not require voice calling.

In the realm of gaming, Cygames has announced the upcoming exhibition 'Cygames Exhibition Artworks' featuring illustrations from their popular games such as 'Uma Musume,' 'Granblue Fantasy,' and 'Shadowverse.' The exhibition will take place at the Ueno Mori Art Museum from September 2nd to October 3rd.

On the employment front, the city of Kyotango in Kyoto Prefecture has announced disciplinary actions against a 41-year-old employee who intentionally damaged their superior's computer. The employee has been subjected to a three-month salary reduction for causing damage amounting to 145,750 yen. It was revealed that the employee had been receiving warnings from their superior regarding their work attitude, and the incident may have been an act of retaliation. Additionally, the employee engaged in defamation and schedule deletion through social media.
