Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 25th, 2023. In today's news, Twitter has unveiled its new logo, which has drawn comparisons to another well-known logo. Just one day after announcing its rebranding, Twitter, now known as 'X', has quickly revealed its new logo. The logo, which features a blue color scheme and a completely different vibe from the old Twitter logo, has sparked discussion for its resemblance to another logo. Moving on to another story, the Tokyo Skytree will be illuminated in a special way to celebrate the upcoming Sumida River Fireworks Festival. This event, which hasn't been held for four years, will see the Tokyo Skytree adorned with special lights. The illumination will not only commemorate the revival of the fireworks festival but will also include a Pikachu-themed light-up display. And that's all for today's news. Stay tuned for more updates from TotemoTech.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
