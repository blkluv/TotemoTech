Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on April 25th. Let's start with the latest tech news.

Freelancers in Japan are welcoming the progress of AI, with over half of them believing that it has a positive impact on their work, according to a survey conducted by a GMO subsidiary. Meanwhile, the skill marketplace, CocoNara, has released a new feature called "AI Assistant (β)" that utilizes the AI model "GPT-3.5 terbo" to support sellers in their listings.

Moving on to some practical tips, with summer approaching, it's time to do a trial run of your air conditioning unit. A simple method has been introduced to ensure that your AC is working properly before the hot weather hits.

In other news, the Japanese police have issued a warning about the surge in fraudulent online banking transactions, with losses exceeding 500 million yen in March alone. The increase in these incidents started in August 2022 and, after a brief lull, has been on the rise again since February 2023.

For those interested in TV programming, NHK's TV show "Makaizo no Yoru" has become a regular monthly broadcast starting from April 27th. The show features engineers who take on extreme modification projects.

Lastly, Apple gift cards are now available for purchase with a 10% cashback offer at various convenience stores and LINE Pay in Japan. The campaign runs until May 7th and is applicable for purchases of up to 100,000 yen. Additionally, Givery has released a new service called "Gyosei GPT," a ChatGPT environment designed specifically for government agencies, featuring the standard installation of "GPT-4" and security features to prevent confidential information from being entered.

And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
