### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on December 30th, 2023. In today's news, we have two interesting stories to discuss. First, let's talk about the latest trends in mechanical keyboards. The traditional terms like 'red axis' and 'blue axis' are no longer in vogue. Today, we'll learn about the key switches that are essential for the best mechanical keyboards. Our guest speaker, biaako, a developer of custom keyboards, will explain how the trending key switches are being evaluated.

Moving on to our second story, Mapion, a web map service provider, is offering a new feature on their PC version. They now display the sunrise times for New Year's Day, also known as 'hatsuhinode.' Users can even post about it on social media. This feature will surely come in handy for those planning to catch the first sunrise of 2024.

Next, let's dive into an intriguing career transition. There is a person who switched from working at JAXA to becoming a production coordinator in the anime industry. His name is Kazuyasu Narita. We'll explore why he made this career move and discuss the differences and similarities between his previous and current roles. We also had the opportunity to interview Mr. Narita, who is also the author of 'Project Shin Evangelion,' about his experiences and insights into managing anime projects.

Shifting gears, we'll now focus on Japan's electronic and IT industry, which seems to be falling behind globally. According to JEITA, the industry has experienced significant demand fluctuations due to the global pandemic, wars, inflation, and the emergence of AI. We'll take a look at JEITA's public data to reflect on the events of 2023 and predict the future societal changes that lie ahead.

Moving on, Doshisha University is embarking on a year-long pilot experiment to incorporate generative AI into their education system. We'll hear from the key person behind this initiative to understand the goals and objectives of this practical trial.

Now, let's talk about an exciting development for cosplay enthusiasts. KDDI and WOGO have announced the introduction of the 'Cosplay 3D Scan Studio' at Comic Market 103. Attendees can have their entire bodies scanned to create 3D models, all for free. This innovative experience is sure to attract cosplayers and technology enthusiasts alike.

Lastly, we'll address a significant incident that occurred in 2023, the 'Zengin System Failure.' We'll delve into the reasons behind this incident, the ongoing changes in Japan's financial industry, and the challenges that lie ahead.

That wraps up today's news from TotemoTech. Stay tuned for more updates on the latest tech trends and developments. Thank you for listening!   Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
