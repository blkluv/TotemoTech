### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on March 24th, 2024. In today's news, we have two interesting stories to share.

First up, we have a revolutionary product called the 'WILLCOOK HO-ON,' a portable microwave bag that won the Best of Innovation award at CES 2024. This innovative bag, which is like a microwave, can heat up cold food like a hot steamed bun just by putting it inside. It's truly a game-changer, and the story behind its development is fascinating.

Moving on to our second story, with the increasing popularity of teleworking in the IT industry, the way we work has become more diverse, and the choices for devices and furniture have expanded. Today, we'll be focusing on PFU, the company behind the well-known 'HHKB' and 'ScanSnap.' We'll take a look at the desk environments of the employees at PFU and how they support their work.
