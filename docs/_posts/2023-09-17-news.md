### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on September 17th, 2023. In today's news, we have two significant stories to discuss. First, energy trading company Shinanen unveiled the wireless charging system for electric vehicles called WiTricity Halo at the Carbon-Free Management Expo in Tokyo. This system, developed by the US startup WiTricity, aims to eliminate the hassle of cables and will be available in Japan starting in 2025.

Moving on to our second story, Mazda has announced a potential data breach. The company revealed that it had experienced unauthorized access from external sources, which may have led to the leakage of personal information. The affected accounts include those of Mazda employees, as well as employees and business partners of affiliated companies, totaling over 100,000 accounts.

In other news, the Digital Transformation Preparation Office of the Cabinet Secretariat has been established with a team of approximately 50 members. This office, located within the Digital Agency, was launched on September 13th under the supervision of Digital Minister Taro Kono.

According to a recent report by IBM Japan, the cost of data breaches has increased by 15% over the past three years. The report highlights that the average global cost of a data breach in 2023 reached a record high of $4.45 million.

Databricks, a US-based data analytics platform, has secured over 73 billion yen in funding and formed a partnership with NVIDIA. The company aims to address the ongoing shortage of GPUs, with its CEO stating that even 10,000 GPUs are not enough to meet demand.

Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation has received its first order for the new eCanter electric truck. The order comes from Yamato Transport, a leading delivery service in Japan, which plans to introduce approximately 900 eCanter trucks for last-mile delivery by the end of the fiscal year.

Lastly, Microsoft and Oracle have announced a strengthened partnership. As part of this collaboration, Oracle's database infrastructure product, Oracle Exadata, will be physically installed in Microsoft's data centers, enabling both companies to better meet the demand for artificial intelligence applications.
