### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on November 1st, 2023. In today's news, NTT Docomo, a subsidiary of the NTT Group, has announced that NTT Communications will begin offering the satellite broadband internet service 'Starlink Business' by the end of this year. This move aims to provide reliable and high-speed internet connectivity to businesses. Moving on, ELYZA, an AI startup born out of the University of Tokyo, has successfully reduced approximately 50% of its workload in certain tasks through a language generation AI collaboration with Tokyo Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance. This achievement demonstrates the potential of AI in streamlining operations and improving efficiency. Shifting gears, Japan Oracle has started offering free learning programs related to AI and its own cloud service, 'Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.' This initiative, which runs from November 1st, 2023, to January 31st, 2024, aims to equip individuals with essential skills in AI and cloud computing. Additionally, the Data Scientist Association has released the 5th edition of the 'Data Scientist Skill Checklist,' which includes new skills related to the utilization of generative AI. This checklist serves as a valuable resource for individuals looking to enhance their data science expertise. On the topic of communication apps, rumors have been circulating that LINE users who do not agree to the new privacy policy will no longer be able to use the app after November 1st. However, LINE and Yahoo Japan clarified that the situation is slightly different, stating that users who do not agree to the new policy will experience limited functionality rather than a complete shutdown. Shifting focus, the Consumer Affairs Agency in Japan has issued corrective orders to four companies selling 'low-carb rice cookers' for falsely advertising their products as effective in reducing carbohydrates. The companies were unable to provide scientific evidence to support their claims. Lastly, SoftBank has announced the launch of a domestic large language model (LLM) computing platform with a capacity of 350 billion parameters. This platform, which is one of the largest in Japan, aims to accelerate the development of generative AI applications. That wraps up today's news from TotemoTech. Stay tuned for more updates on the latest tech developments.   Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
