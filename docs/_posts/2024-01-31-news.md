### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on January 31st, 2024. In today's news, we have two significant stories to discuss. First, let's talk about the evolution of 'Windows Copilot' on Microsoft's 'Edge'. 'Copilot' originally meant 'co-pilot', but its meaning has changed since the introduction of AI. Microsoft has adopted the name 'Copilot' for their AI-powered tool on the 'Edge' browser. This tool has been gaining attention for its ability to assist developers in writing code, providing suggestions and completing lines of code. Many developers have found it helpful, but some have also raised concerns about potential security risks and the potential impact on the job market.

Moving on to our second story, Panasonic Holdings is planning to expand its AI-controlled energy-saving service overseas in the late 2020s. Using AI, Panasonic aims to reduce electricity consumption in commercial air conditioning systems. The service will initially be launched for offices and stores in Japan starting from April this year, and then expanded to the United States, Europe, and other regions. With the global trend towards decarbonization and rising electricity costs, there is increasing demand for energy-efficient solutions in commercial air conditioning. Panasonic's new service is part of the growing efforts by various electronics companies to develop innovative products and services in this field.

Next, let's discuss the digitalization of the House of Representatives in Japan. Representatives from different political parties have held their first meeting to discuss the digitalization of the House of Representatives. The meeting focused on utilizing online platforms for committee hearings, promoting paperless operations, and installing monitors in committee rooms. The aim is to improve efficiency and accessibility in the parliamentary process. This move towards digitalization reflects the changing landscape of governance and the increasing use of technology in political institutions.

In other news, starting from April 1st, Japan Post will delay the delivery time for 'Yu-Pack' and express mail by half a day to one day in certain regions. This change is implemented as part of their measures to address the '2024 problem', which refers to the anticipated increase in mail volume due to the expiration of certain patents related to barcode technology. The delay in delivery time aims to manage the expected surge in mail volume and ensure smooth operations.

Lastly, let's talk about the business potential of 'VTuber' combined with AI-generated content. The CEO of Hololive Production, a VTuber agency, stated that they are not considering AI-generated VTubers as a business. The CEO emphasized that their focus is on human VTubers and creating a unique experience for their audience. While AI-generated content has gained attention in various industries, the CEO believes that human VTubers bring a personal touch and connection that cannot be replicated by AI.
