### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on April 22nd, 2024. In our first news story, there was controversy surrounding a recent automatic conversion feature on the popular social media platform, Twitter.com. Users found that when they posted the string 'Twitter.com', it would automatically be converted to 'X.com'. This phenomenon occurred in early April and raised concerns about potential fraud. However, the issue was quickly resolved after receiving criticism from users. Moving on to our next story, stargazers are eagerly anticipating the peak of the April Lyrids meteor shower, which is set to occur soon. Every year, in late April, the April Lyrids meteor shower reaches its maximum intensity, providing a dazzling display in the night sky. Now, let's turn our attention to the world of entertainment. The latest installment of the popular detective series, 'Detective Conan', titled 'Detective Conan: The Five-Star Stories with a Million Dollars', has been in theaters since April 12th. However, some social media users have been discussing the subpar animation quality in the second half of the movie. Moving on to technology news, the Shikoku Regional Development Bureau of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism posted a photo on X (formerly known as Twitter) featuring a sign that read 'Creating Minecraft World Data'. This image sparked interest and comparisons to photoshopped images due to its resemblance to a scene from the popular video game Minecraft. The bureau explained that the post was meant to showcase the surveying process for expanding the 'National Sanuki Mannou Park' and the free release of the corresponding Minecraft world data. Shifting gears to web browsers, users of the browser version of X were surprised to find that the 'Trends' section had been replaced by a new section called 'Explore'. By clicking on 'Show more', users can access the traditional trend display page. Finally, in business news, Japanese food and beverage company Ezaki Glico announced a temporary halt in the shipment of chilled products, including popular items like 'Cafe au Lait' and 'Pudding'. This decision was made due to a system malfunction. Lastly, Universal Studios Japan (USJ) announced a delay in the opening of the 'Donkey Kong' area until the latter half of 2024 in order to enhance its overall quality and experience. That's all for today's news. Thank you for listening to TotemoTech. Stay tuned for more updates on the latest tech news.
