### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on August 26th, 2023. In today's news, we have two significant stories to discuss.

First, let's talk about Rakuten. Rakuten is a popular online marketplace in Japan that regularly holds a shopping event called the Rakuten Shopping Marathon. During this event, customers can earn Rakuten points based on their purchases. However, on August 24th, there was a sudden change in the event. The maximum points that can be earned during the marathon were reduced from 7,000 to 5,000 points. This reduction has raised concerns among customers who were used to earning more points. The reason behind this change is yet to be revealed.

Moving on to our second story, let's talk about CyberConnect2. This game development company recently sparked a discussion with a social media post made by its president. The post criticized the game industry for not meeting the minimum requirements to become a successful industry. It turns out that CyberConnect2 has been facing challenges in terms of training and hiring new talent. The company is now working on strategies to address these issues and improve the development of the game industry.

These were the two significant news stories for today. Stay tuned for more updates on TotemoTech.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
