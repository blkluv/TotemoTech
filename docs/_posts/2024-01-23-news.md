Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on January 23rd, 2024. In today's news, convenience stores across Japan have started offering resident registration copies through the My Number Card function on smartphones. This service allows users to obtain copies of their resident registration without having to visit the local government office. Instead, they can use the multi-copy machines available at FamilyMart and Lawson stores nationwide.

Moving on to gaming news, the development team behind the popular 3D open-world game 'Palworld' has recently been subjected to online abuse and even death threats. Pocket Pair, the company behind the game, revealed that they have been receiving defamatory messages. The CEO, Takuro Mizonobe, has taken full responsibility for the situation and has urged people to refrain from engaging in such behavior.

In other news, JAXA, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, has announced that they will hold a press conference on January 25th to present the findings from the SLIM mission, a small lunar landing demonstration vehicle. The press conference will be live-streamed on YouTube.

Shifting back to 'Palworld,' despite its immense popularity with over 4 million copies sold, some players have expressed a deep sense of guilt while playing the game. They find it incredibly entertaining but feel a profound 'apology' in their hearts. This emotional conflict has sparked discussions among gamers.

Moving on to JAXA's SLIM mission, the agency has confirmed that they have successfully obtained a significant amount of data from the small demonstration vehicle that is believed to have made a soft landing on the moon. They have also mentioned the possibility of recovery.

In tech-related news, NTT Communications (NTT Com) recently faced criticism when users reported that after purchasing second-hand PCs and attempting to install Windows, they were confronted with NTT Com's internal settings screen, rendering the PCs unusable. The company has apologized for the inconvenience and provided an explanation.

Lastly, the long-standing forum site 'Slad,' which focuses on computer and open-source software news and discussions, will be closing at the end of January 2024 after 23 years of operation.

That's all for today's news. Thank you for listening to TotemoTech. Stay tuned for more updates on the latest technology and news from Japan.   Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
