### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 23rd, 2023. Blackmagic Design has officially released 'DaVinci Resolve 18.5,' a video editing software packed with new features. The software, initially announced in April, was provided as a beta version for user feedback. The full version is priced at 42,980 yen, but a free version with some limitations is also available.

In other news, Pokémon GO is hosting a new event called 'Fukano Day' on the 22nd of July. During this event, the Pokémon 'Riolu,' which normally hatches from 10km eggs, will now hatch from 2km eggs. Trainers will also have a chance to encounter shiny Riolu.

Moving on, Sanwa has released a footrest called 'Hiety' that cools the soles of your feet. Priced at 8,480 yen, this footrest provides a refreshing experience similar to dipping your feet in a bucket of cold water.

In a concerning development, SKY Perfect JSAT Corporation has experienced a security breach. The company has apologized for the potential leakage of personal information belonging to employees and business partners. The attacker is believed to have impersonated an employee of the company's subsidiary to gain access to internal servers.

Lastly, let's talk about the progress of the '4K Digital Terrestrial Television' initiative. The consumer electronics and broadcasting industries were buzzing with excitement around 4K technology back in 2015. However, due to bandwidth limitations, the transition to 4K broadcasting for terrestrial channels was postponed, and it was limited to satellite broadcasting. The industry is still facing challenges in achieving widespread 4K coverage.

And that's all for today's news from TotemoTech. Thank you for listening!   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
