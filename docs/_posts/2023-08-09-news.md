### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on August 9th, 2023. In today's news, we have two significant stories to cover.

First, let's talk about Twitter's monetization program. Yesterday, Twitter launched its creator ad revenue sharing program in Japan, allowing influencers to openly disclose the amount of money they earn. This program, which started in the United States and is now being gradually rolled out in Japan, aims to support creators and provide them with a source of income. It's interesting to see how much money some of the popular influencers are making through this program.

Moving on to our second story, it seems that Japan's defense network has been targeted by cyber attacks from China. According to reports, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has infiltrated Japan's defense network, potentially compromising sensitive information. The Washington Post revealed that this cyber espionage took place in 2020 and was described as one of the most harmful hacking incidents in Japanese history. The Japanese government has been alerted about the situation, and officials from the United States have arrived in Japan to share information and address the threat.

That's all for today's news from TotemoTech. Stay tuned for more updates on the world of technology.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
