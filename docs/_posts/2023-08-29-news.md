Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on August 29th, 2023. In today's news, we have two exciting stories to share. First, the Tokyo Keizai Shimbun's AI-powered service, Shikiho AI, is now in its beta version. Shikiho AI utilizes ChatGPT and draws on articles and data from the company's online quarterly reports to provide interactive tips for stock investment. It's fascinating to see how AI is being leveraged in this way.

Moving on to our second story, the renowned visual effects (VFX) production company, White Group, is celebrating its 50th anniversary. Known for its expertise in 2D to 3DCG and VFX animation techniques, White Group has been a pioneer in VFX for Japanese films. Their work can be seen in movies like 'Shin Godzilla' and 'STAND BY ME Doraemon.' Congratulations to White Group on this milestone!

Next, we have Oriental Air Bridge, an airline company, issuing an apology after discovering that a former employee took confidential information upon retirement. The employee claimed that they thought it would be useful in their new job. It's a reminder of the importance of safeguarding sensitive company data.

In other news, Itoen, a well-known beverage company, has announced that they will be using image-generating AI for the packaging design of their upcoming product, 'Oi Ocha Catechin Green Tea.' This is the first time Itoen has implemented such technology, aiming to create products that not only have great content but also visually appeal to consumers.

Shifting gears, Rakuten Mobile has reached a significant milestone as their MNO (Mobile Network Operator) service has surpassed 5 million subscribers since its launch in April 2020. It's impressive to see the growth of Rakuten Mobile in the competitive mobile market.

Now, let's talk about a new web map service called 'Rekichizu.' Developed by a designer from a map system company, this service allows users to overlay historical maps from the Edo period with modern maps for easy comparison. It's a fantastic tool for those interested in exploring the past and present geography of Japan.

Lastly, MUJI, the popular retail brand, has announced that they will start selling their products, including cosmetics and daily goods, on the fashion e-commerce site 'ZOZOTOWN' starting from September 1st. This collaboration will provide customers with a convenient way to access MUJI's minimalist and high-quality products.
