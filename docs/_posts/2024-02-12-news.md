### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on February 12th, 2024. In today's news, the movie 'Mobile Suit Gundam SEED FREEDOM' has made a strong start, surprising manga artist with its romantic comedy elements. The film is a completely new installment in the Gundam series, coming almost 20 years after the TV series. It seems to be receiving positive reviews, and I decided to watch it myself.

Moving on to our next story, the Pokemon Company has announced the development of an AI called 'Pokemon Battle Scope' (PBS) that specializes in Pokemon battles. They collaborated with a shogi AI company and plan to utilize PBS for live streaming the 'Ryuoh Tournament.' This AI is expected to enhance the excitement and analysis of Pokemon battles.

Next, we have an announcement from Chatwork. The company has decided to change its name to 'kubell' (pronounced as 'koo-bell'). The name was inspired by the phrase 'to put firewood on the fire,' and the change will be officially approved at the shareholders' meeting on July 1st. Chatwork aims to continue its growth and evolution under the new name.

In other news, a male employee of a real estate sales company, identified as Kazuma Kataoka, was arrested for allegedly accessing and viewing the business card management system 'Sansan' without authorization. He impersonated an employee of the operating company and obtained IDs and passwords from users. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police's Cybercrime Division arrested him on suspicion of violating the Unauthorized Access Prohibition Act. Kataoka denies the allegations.

Moving on, due to the Noto Peninsula earthquake in the Reiwa 6 era, some areas experienced delays in the distribution and release of Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. To address this, the editorial department of Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump has decided to provide free access to several issues, including the latest ones, through their official app. This gesture aims to ensure that readers in affected regions can still enjoy the magazine's content.

In a separate news story, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has issued administrative guidance to NTT West Japan regarding the leakage of over 9 million personal information records from one of its subsidiaries. The ministry invoked the Telecommunications Business Act and the NTT Law to guide the company. NTT West Japan is required to review its handling of personal information and thoroughly implement measures to prevent recurrence. They have been instructed to submit a report on the implementation status of these measures by March 29th.

Lastly, the Tokyo District Court has dismissed a VTuber's request for the disclosure of sender information in relation to comments posted on an online bulletin board. The court's decision, which failed to grant the disclosure, has been published on the official website. The VTuber claimed that the comments on '5channel' violated their privacy, reputation, and copyright, but all of their claims were dismissed by the court.
