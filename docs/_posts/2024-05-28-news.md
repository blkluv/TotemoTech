Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on May 28th, 2024. Today, we have some interesting news stories to share with you. First up, Australian online design tool Canva has announced new features and content specifically tailored for the Japanese market. Canva has strengthened its collaboration with popular free image site Irasutoya and leading font provider Morisawa. They have also introduced a new feature that displays hiragana characters, targeting younger elementary school students.

In other news, Japan Post has made a change to its 'Yubin ID' service. As of today, it will be known as 'Yu ID'. When asked about the reason behind this change, Japan Post stated that it was a deliberate decision, but did not provide further details.

Moving on, there have been recent updates to the My Number Card system in Japan. With the implementation of the revised My Number Act, the functionality and usability of the card have been expanded. One notable change is that the card will no longer expire if you move abroad, as long as you submit a pre-application. Additionally, the regulations regarding personal authentication using the My Number Card have been clarified. It is now possible to authenticate without entering a PIN code, using a contactless method called 'kazashi riyo'.

Now, let's talk about some exciting news for gamers. Square Enix, the developer behind the popular Dragon Quest series, is rumored to be releasing a remake of Dragon Quest 3 soon. After a long period of silence, fans are eagerly anticipating this release.

And speaking of Dragon Quest, there is also news about the development of Dragon Quest 12. In a recent post, series creator Yuji Horii mentioned that he had just finished a meeting discussing the game. This update reassures fans who have been eagerly awaiting the next installment in the beloved franchise.

Shifting gears, let's talk about NHK, Japan's public broadcasting organization. NHK Chairman Nobuo Inaba has revealed that the mandatory provision of internet services by NHK will likely begin in the second half of the fiscal year 2025. This follows the passage of the revised Broadcasting Act in the Japanese parliament. Inaba also mentioned that the internet reception fee will be set at the same level as the terrestrial contract fee.

Lastly, we have news about a new type of eyewear called 'Dejitime' by Barilax. These glasses are equipped with a dedicated smartphone zone and aim to alleviate the problem of poor visibility faced by people with presbyopia. I had the opportunity to try out these glasses for about a month, and they seem to significantly improve the experience of using smartphones for individuals with presbyopia. They could be considered as the 'work glasses' of the digital age.

That wraps up today's news from TotemoTech. Thank you for tuning in, and we'll be back with more tech updates soon.   Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
