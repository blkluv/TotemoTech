Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on September 28th, 2023. In today's news, Meta, formerly known as Facebook, has made two significant announcements at their event 'Meta Connect 2023'. First, they have unveiled a new model of smart glasses called 'Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glass Collection'. These glasses come with a built-in camera, microphone, and speaker, allowing users to livestream and have conversations with their AI assistant, 'Meta AI'. This integration of technology and eyewear opens up new possibilities for augmented reality experiences.

In addition to the smart glasses, Meta has also announced the upcoming release of their new VR headset, 'Meta Quest 3'. The headset, which is set to be available for pre-order starting today and released on October 10th in Japan, boasts enhanced mixed reality capabilities and a passthrough resolution twice as high as the previous Quest Pro model. With prices starting at 74,800 yen for the 128GB model and 96,800 yen for the 512GB model, the Meta Quest 3 aims to provide users with an immersive and high-quality virtual reality experience.

Moving on to other news, the popular conveyor belt sushi chain, Akindo Sushiro, has introduced a new concept called 'Digiro'. This innovative system combines digital vision technology with the traditional conveyor belt, creating a futuristic dining experience. Currently being trialed in three selected stores, Digiro aims to enhance efficiency and provide customers with a unique and interactive dining experience.

In the world of wearable technology, Nothing, a subsidiary brand of English tech company Nothing, has launched three new products under their sub-brand 'CMF by Nothing'. These include the 'Watch Pro', a stylish smartwatch priced at $69 with a battery life of 13 days, the 'Buds Pro' wireless earbuds, and the 'Power 65W GaN charger'. While the availability of these products in Japan is currently uncertain, they showcase Nothing's commitment to delivering affordable and well-designed tech products.

On the topic of online shopping, the National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan has issued a warning about a new type of fraud targeting online shoppers. Scammers are deceiving consumers by instructing them to make refunds through specific payment apps, leading to unauthorized money transfers instead of legitimate refunds. It is essential for online shoppers to remain vigilant and verify refund procedures to avoid falling victim to this scam.

Shifting gears to gaming news, Chinese company GPD Technology is set to release the domestic version of their portable gaming PC, 'GPD WIN Mini', in late December. Weighing just 520g, this compact gaming device offers a maximum memory capacity of 64GB. With a price starting at 115,100 yen, the GPD WIN Mini provides gamers with a portable and powerful gaming experience.

Lastly, Panasonic has announced the launch of their latest addition to the G series, the 'G9PROII'. This high-end camera is designed with photography enthusiasts in mind, boasting a resolution of 100 million pixels and a focus on handheld high-resolution photography. The G9PROII is a long-awaited model for Micro Four Thirds photographers and promises to deliver stunning image quality.

That wraps up today's news from TotemoTech. Stay tuned for more updates on the latest tech innovations and developments.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
