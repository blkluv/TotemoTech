Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on August 23rd, 2023. In today's news, Sakura Internet has announced that it will expedite its investment plan for GPU cloud services, originally scheduled for June. The company has decided to invest 7.85 billion yen in 2024. Moving on to our next story, Toei has released a making-of video showcasing the behind-the-scenes of the production of the tokusatsu drama 'Ousama Sentai King Oja.' The video highlights the use of a giant LED panel called 'LED Wall' and the virtual production technique. Now, let's talk about Tokyo University's Matsuo Laboratory. They have removed the 'open source' description from their large language model 'Weblab-10B' that was released on August 18th. The lab stated that it does not meet the definition of open source due to commercial restrictions. Shifting gears, Yamaha has started an experimental project for AI vocal synthesis. They have provided creators with a prototype AI vocal synthesis software called 'VX-β' to gather feedback and improve the software. Next up, Assured, a security evaluation service provider, has announced the results of a survey conducted with 300 information system professionals. The survey aimed to identify past cloud-related troubles encountered by companies. And now, the moment Monster Hunter fans have been waiting for. Niantic has revealed that the pre-registration for their AR location-based game 'Monster Hunter Now' has surpassed 2 million users. Finally, the popular illustration SNS 'pixiv' has introduced two-factor authentication to enhance account security. Users now have the option to enable 2FA using authentication apps like 'Google Authenticator' or 'Microsoft Authenticator'. That's all for today's news. Stay tuned for more updates from TotemoTech.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
