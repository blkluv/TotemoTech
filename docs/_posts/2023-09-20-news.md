### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on September 20th, 2023. In today's news, we have two significant stories to discuss. First, YAMAP, the provider of the mountain map app, has launched a website where users can check the real-time autumn foliage conditions across Japan. This new feature allows outdoor enthusiasts to plan their trips and enjoy the beautiful autumn colors.

Moving on to our second story, Google Japan has announced new features for their chat AI called Bard. Bard can now be integrated with Gmail and Google Drive, among other Google apps. This means that Bard can generate responses by referencing a user's files and emails, providing assistance and answers. Although initially available only in English, this expansion of Bard's capabilities opens up new possibilities for productivity and convenience.

That's all for today's news from TotemoTech. Stay tuned for more updates on the latest tech developments!   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
