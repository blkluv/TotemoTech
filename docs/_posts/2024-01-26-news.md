Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on January 26th, 2024. In today's news, we have some interesting stories from Japan.

First, let's talk about a new sales approach called 'Scrum Sales.' This method, implemented by a former engineer, aims to improve productivity by addressing the challenges of traditional sales models. By having the entire sales team handle all customers and processes, Scrum Sales has managed to increase order amounts by 4.5 times in just one year.

Next, we have an update from Yomiuri Newspaper. The media company has announced changes to its usage policy for their online platform. They will now prohibit the use of their articles for AI training purposes, including generating AI-generated content. These changes will take effect from February 1st.

Moving on, a group of nine music-related organizations, including JASRAC, the Japan Society for Rights of Authors, Composers, and Publishers, have formed the 'AI Music Consortium.' The consortium aims to promote the balanced and responsible use of AI-generated music. They will collaborate on recommendations and discussions regarding the utilization of AI in the music industry.

In other news, the popular smartphone app 'Love Live! School Idol Festival 2 MIRACLE LIVE!' will be ending its service at the end of March. The game, developed by Bushiroad, has decided to close its doors after just one year of operation.

Now, let's talk about space exploration. JAXA, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, has provided an update on the small lunar landing demonstrator 'SLIM.' Despite losing one thruster before landing, SLIM successfully touched down with a precision of 100 meters. This achievement opens up the possibility of resuming operations for future missions.

In a tragic update, the verdict for the Kyoto Animation arson case was announced. The defendant, Shinji Aoba, has been sentenced to death for the murder of 36 people and the injury of 32 others. The court determined that Aoba had full criminal responsibility and was not suffering from any mental disorders at the time of the crime.

Lastly, we have news from the world of gaming. The Pokémon Company has released a statement regarding inquiries about other companies' games that bear similarities to Pokémon. They clarified that they have not granted any licenses for the use of Pokémon in other games and are currently investigating allegations of plagiarism surrounding the game 'Paruworld.'
