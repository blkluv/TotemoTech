Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on October 27th, 2023. In today's news, Chinese company DJI has announced the Osmo Pocket 3, a compact camera with a built-in gimbal. The Osmo Pocket 3 features a 1-inch CMOS sensor and a rotating 2-inch LCD display, allowing users to easily turn the power on and off and change the composition of their shots. It's a versatile camera for capturing high-quality footage.

Moving on to our next story, the publisher of the book 'Otaku Dictionary: The Ultimate Limit' has released a statement in response to the controversy surrounding the book. The publisher, Sanseido, acknowledges the shortcomings and inappropriate examples pointed out in the book's definitions and states that they have made improvements where possible. They also urge people to refrain from making derogatory comments towards others involved in the book.

Now, let's talk about some tech-related updates. Starting from December 1st, NTT Docomo will be increasing the service fees for various procedures conducted at their call centers. This includes new contract applications, which will now incur a fee of 3,850 yen, the same as the fee charged at physical stores. The change aims to align the costs across different channels.

In other news, office furniture manufacturer Okamura has announced the release of the 'Okamura Digital Collection,' a collection of 3D data for their chairs. These 3D models can be used not only in virtual spaces but also as backgrounds for VTubers' livestreams or manga illustrations. The collection offers a wide range of possibilities for creators to enhance their visual content.

Moving on, X, formerly known as Twitter, has introduced voice and video calling features to its iOS app. By default, all users have the incoming call feature enabled, allowing followers to call them. However, this change has received mixed reviews from Japanese users, with some expressing dissatisfaction with the default settings.

In a fascinating development, CoeFont has released the official version of their voice changer app, 'CoeFont Voice Changer,' for Windows. The app, which was previously available as a beta version with only three voice options, now offers ten different voices. One of the new additions is a voice based on the popular voice actor Tomokazu Morikawa. Users can now have their voices transformed into Morikawa's distinctive voice.

Lastly, business card management platform Sansan has made its training materials on test code freely available for new graduates. The materials explain the testing methods in Python and provide guidance on writing effective test code. This initiative aims to support new graduates in acquiring essential coding skills.
