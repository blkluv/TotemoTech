### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on October 22nd, 2023. In today's news, we have some interesting stories to cover. First up, Sadataro-san, a manga artist and self-proclaimed watermelon expert, has found a unique way to overcome his creative slump. He got hooked on a game called 'Suika Game' after watching a VTuber's gameplay. It seems that he was able to consistently create watermelons for a while, but recently, he's been facing some challenges.

Moving on, let's talk about Canon. At their recent event called 'Canon Expo 2023,' they showcased their latest technologies and solutions. One particular exhibit caught our attention: two satellites equipped with Canon's DSLR cameras. Yes, you heard it right! Canon has launched not just one, but two satellites with cameras onboard. This opens up new possibilities for satellite imaging and remote sensing.

Next, we have the Orionid meteor shower, which is set to peak tonight. This annual meteor shower occurs when the Earth passes through debris left behind by Halley's Comet. The best time to observe the Orionid meteor shower will be during the late evening and early morning hours. If you're on the Pacific side, you might have a chance to witness this celestial spectacle. There will also be live streams available for those who are unable to see it in person.

In other news, author Kumiori Saori, known for the novel 'Dragon Quest V,' has lost a lawsuit against Square Enix. She filed a lawsuit claiming that the name of the protagonist, Luca, and certain public appeals were used without permission in a movie adaptation. However, the Tokyo District Court dismissed her claims.

The National Institute of Informatics (NII) has made a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing. They have released a large-scale language model called 'LLM-jp-13B,' which consists of 13 billion parameters. This open-source model, along with the corpus and tools, aims to support academic and industrial research and development.

In the world of electric vehicles, Toyota has announced that they will adopt Tesla's charging standard, NACS, for their battery-powered vehicles sold in North America. This agreement between Toyota and Tesla marks the third Japanese automaker to adopt the NACS standard, following Nissan and Honda. This move is expected to improve charging infrastructure and convenience for EV owners.

Lastly, let's talk about the government's cloud service certification program, known as ISMAP. When a service is registered under ISMAP, various information about the service becomes publicly available. If you're aiming to get your service listed, it's important to be aware of what information will be disclosed and what will remain private.
