### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 3rd, 2023. In today's news, we have two interesting stories to share.

First, a retro fan has become an internet sensation. The 'Mini Fan' by Seiki Koizumi has been making waves on social media. With its nostalgic retro design and compact size of around 40cm, this fan brings back memories of the Showa era. We had the opportunity to speak with the developers to learn more about why this retro-style fan was created in the Reiwa era.

Moving on to our second story, we have news from the gaming world. 'Final Fantasy XVI' was released on June 22nd, and one manga artist who completed the game quickly had mixed feelings about it. Despite finding it interesting, they continued to express some reservations. It seems like this highly anticipated game has left them with some lingering thoughts.

Next, let's talk about Twitter. On July 1st, there was a temporary viewing limit imposed on unverified accounts. This restriction caused a buzz on Twitter, with terms like 'Twitter is ending' and 'API regulation' trending in Japan. Elon Musk, CEO of Twitter's parent company, X, tweeted that temporary limitations were put in place. Unverified accounts are now limited to viewing up to 600 tweets per day. However, it's worth noting that this limit has since been relaxed to 1000 tweets per day.

Shifting gears, let's discuss the launch of NTT Docomo's new plans, 'irumo' and 'eximo.' These plans cater to low data usage needs, but there's a catch. Unlike other plans, customers cannot apply for 'irumo' through the Docomo online shop. This unique aspect sets it apart from the rest.

Now, let's address a safety concern for the upcoming summer season. NITE, the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation, is urging caution regarding gadget accidents. They specifically highlight the risks of mobile battery and portable fan fires. With an increase in products from unknown manufacturers and the higher likelihood of malfunctions due to rising temperatures, NITE is providing guidance on how to select and use these devices safely.

In the world of photography, Sigma has introduced the '14mm F1.4 DG DN | Art' lens, which boasts exceptional specifications. This ultra-wide-angle lens not only achieves an impressive F1.4 aperture but is also lighter than its predecessor, the '14mm F1.8 DG HSM | Art.' It's truly a remarkable piece of equipment that has photographers excited.

Moving on, let's delve into the realm of artificial intelligence. Rhizomatiks, a creative collective, showcased the future of AI at a solo exhibition. They presented individual calculations of the behavior of one million slime molds and machine learning using rat brain cells. This glimpse into the future of AI offers a fascinating perspective.

Lastly, we have news for Pokemon GO players. Niantic, the company behind the popular game, has announced the full release of the social app 'Campfire,' which integrates with Pokemon GO. This app provides convenient features for raid battles, making it a valuable tool for trainers.

That wraps up today's news from TotemoTech. Stay tuned for more exciting updates in the world of technology and innovation.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
