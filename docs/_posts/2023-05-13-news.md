Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on May 13th, 2023.

First up, Balmuda has announced the end of their mobile device business, with President Gen Terao reflecting on their lack of ability in the field.

Meanwhile, Makoto Shinkai's film 'Suzume no Tojimari' has released a special version with 273 updated scenes, including added masks in response to the pandemic.

In other news, [Rakuten Mobile](/companies/rakuten-mobile) has strengthened its roaming partnership with [KDDI](/companies/kddi) and announced a new plan, while Toyota has reported a data leak in their telematics service affecting over 2 million vehicles.

Meta, formerly known as Facebook, has launched an AI tool for ad creators called 'AI Sandbox', while [pixiv](/companies/pixiv) has banned AI-generated artwork requests due to concerns over mass commercial use.

Finally, a report from Futurewoods has found that sales messages with fewer words and more concise language tend to have higher click-through rates.

And in a troubling development, it has been revealed that Fujitsu Japan was responsible for a case of mistaken issuance of residency certificates through their convenience store service that uses My Number cards.
