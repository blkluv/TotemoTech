Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on May 15th, 2023. First up, Nintendo's highly anticipated game 'The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom' has left a manga artist feeling disappointed after playing for 10 hours. In other news, the outdoor music festival 'METROCK2023' in Tokyo will be streamed live on ABEMA for free, featuring performances from 71 artists including Creepy Nuts and BiSH. The Enoshima Electric Railway is offering free rides for users of credit card touch payments for one day only on May 15th. Canon has released the Powershot V10, which has evolved into a VLOG camera, but how does it differ from Sony's 'VLOGCAM'? Barumuda's mobile phone business is coming to an end, with the company's president reflecting on the challenge and admitting his own shortcomings. The special version of the film 'Suzume no Tomari' has been updated with new scenes, including the addition of masks, and director Makoto Shinkai has been explaining the changes on Twitter. Finally, Rakuten Mobile has strengthened its roaming partnership with KDDI and announced a new plan called the 'Rakuten Strongest Plan', with the aim of gradually ending roaming contracts and transitioning to its own network. Meta has also announced the release of 'AI Sandbox', an experimental platform for generating AI tools for advertisers, including automatic copy rewriting and background image generation.  And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
