Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on February 28th, 2024. In today's news, we have two significant stories to discuss.

First, there is growing anticipation in Japan regarding the possibility of direct communication between smartphones and satellites. KDDI, which announced a partnership with SpaceX in August 2023, plans to provide a direct communication service between the latest Starlink satellites and smartphones by the end of 2024. This development could have significant implications for improving connectivity and expanding internet access.

Moving on to our second story, a privacy issue has emerged in the realm of smart home products. Wyze, a company specializing in smart home devices, experienced a glitch in their security cameras that displayed images and videos of strangers' houses on users' app screens. This problem, which was also reported in 2023, has raised concerns about the reliability and safety of smart home technology.

In other news, Pokémon enthusiasts will be delighted to hear that a new smartphone app called 'Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket' is set to be released later this year. Developed by Pokémon and in collaboration with Creatures and DeNA, this app will bring the popular trading card game to mobile devices, allowing fans to enjoy the game anytime, anywhere.

Shifting gears to the field of semiconductors, RAPIDUS, a company aiming to promote domestic production of next-generation semiconductors, announced a collaboration with the emerging US firm Tenstorrent for the development and manufacturing of edge AI chips. This partnership aims to achieve mass production at RAPIDUS's new factory in Chitose City, Hokkaido. The joint effort leverages Tenstorrent's expertise in edge AI semiconductor development.

In the realm of national security, a new law called the 'Important Economic Security Information Protection and Utilization Act' has been approved by the Cabinet, introducing the 'Security Clearance' (SC) system to restrict access to classified economic security information to qualified individuals. Defense-related companies, recognizing the importance of SC, have welcomed the legislation as it expands opportunities for joint development and collaboration.

Lastly, in a case of alleged embezzlement, a former Honda employee has been re-arrested by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police. The individual, Shun Kojima, is accused of misusing a corporate credit card for personal purposes, resulting in financial losses for the company. Kojima has admitted to the charges.
