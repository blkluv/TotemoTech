Hello and welcome to TotemoTech on April 26th. Let's take a look at today's news stories.

First up, Japanese space venture ispace attempted to land on the moon, but unfortunately lost communication and could not confirm a successful landing. This would have been the first successful moon landing by a private company.

Next, April 10th was designated as "Air Conditioning Trial Run Day" in Japan, but it turns out that it's not actually the best day for a trial run. Experts explain why this is the case.

Moving on, Niantic, the company behind Pokemon Go, is releasing a new pet-raising game called "Peridot" that uses augmented reality (AR) technology. The game aims to push the boundaries of how much AR can blend into the real world.

In other news, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has changed the name of its subsidiary, Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation, to MSJ Asset Management, following the cancellation of its domestic jet development project.

OpenAI has released guidelines for companies using its API, requesting that they avoid using the term "GPT" in their product names. This has led to several companies changing their service names.

[KDDI](/companies/kddi) has announced that it will stop using health insurance cards as a form of identification for customers due to incidents of fraudulent use. NTT Docomo had already made a similar announcement earlier. Softbank and Rakuten Mobile have not yet announced their plans.

Kyocera has delayed its financial results announcement due to a cyber attack on its US subsidiary, KYOCERA AVX Components Corporation.

Finally, there is currently a competition between various large language models, including OpenAI's exclusive model and the open and free Dolly-v2 model. Experts are keeping an eye on this competition and its implications for the future of language processing technology.

And that's all for today's news. Thanks for tuning in to TotemoTech.
