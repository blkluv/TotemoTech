### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 2nd, 2023. In today's news, we have two significant stories.

First, Digital Minister Taro Kono apologized for the reoccurrence of the issue of incorrect issuance of resident certificates due to the Fujitsu Japan convenience store delivery system. During a press conference after the cabinet meeting on June 30th, Minister Kono expressed his regret, saying, 'I apologize for the inconvenience caused by the reoccurrence of the incident, even after we reported the completion of a comprehensive inspection last week on Tuesday, June 20th.'

Moving on to our second story, the Ministry of Internal Affairs issued a written administrative guidance to Fujitsu on June 30th. This action was taken in response to the unauthorized access to the network equipment that constitutes the corporate internet service 'FENICS' provided by Fujitsu.

Next, NTT Docomo, NTT Communications, and NTT Comware announced a new service on June 28th. This service utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze video footage and monitor the water levels of rivers and reservoirs. The aim is to provide this service to corporations and local governments for a fee as a trial until March 2024, with the goal of full-scale service launch.

In other news, AGC succeeded in producing glass using ammonia fuel. The demonstration test was conducted in a production reactor at the AGC Yokohama Technical Center from June 18th to 19th.

Furthermore, Microwave Chemical Co. (MWCC) and Mitsui & Co. have entered into a joint development agreement for the refinement technology of lithium (Li) ore using microwave technology. This is the first technology in the world to use microwaves for the refinement of Li ore.

Moving on, WOWOW announced on June 30th that there has been a leakage of personal information for up to 88,790 users of its video streaming service, WOWOW On Demand. This incident occurred between June 9th, 1:00 PM, and June 22nd, 11:11 PM.

Additionally, another incident related to the incorrect issuance of resident certificates using the Fujitsu Japan system has occurred in Munakata City, Fukuoka Prefecture. The city revealed on June 29th that a mistake was made in issuing a copy of a resident certificate to the wrong person in the certificate issuance service using the My Number Card. The cause of the issue was a malfunction in the Fujitsu Japan convenience store delivery system called 'Fujitsu MICJET Convenience Store Delivery.'

Lastly, MMD Labo released the results of a survey on June 30th regarding the awareness of the 'MNP One-Stop Method.' The survey conducted by MMD Labo showed that the awareness of the Mobile Number Portability (MNP) One-Stop Method was only 13.9%.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
