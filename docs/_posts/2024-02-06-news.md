### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on February 6th, 2024. In today's news, a research institution in the United States has developed an open-source implementation of China's internet censorship system known as the 'Great Firewall.' The Aperture Internet Laboratory has announced the release of 'OpenGFW,' a Linux-based system that replicates the functionality of the Chinese system. This development raises questions about the global impact of internet censorship and the implications for online freedom.

Moving on to our next story, a researcher from NLA University College in Norway has analyzed the media coverage of an unusual form of climate change protest. Oleksandr Kapranov studied reports of people throwing food at famous paintings as a way to draw attention to the urgent need for action on climate change. The analysis explores the effectiveness of such protests in raising awareness and stimulating public discourse.

Next, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has utilized digital technology to provide a 3D viewer showcasing the damage caused by the Noto Peninsula earthquake. The 'Tokyo Digital Twin 3D Viewer' now includes geographical data related to the impact of the earthquake that occurred in 2023. This innovative approach allows users to visualize the extent of the damage and assists in planning for future disaster mitigation strategies.

In entertainment news, the highly anticipated musical adaptation of 'JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Phantom Blood' has faced setbacks. The production companies, Toho and Imperial Theatre, have announced the cancellation of the first four performances, including the opening night, due to insufficient preparation time. Fans of the popular manga series will have to wait a little longer to experience the live adaptation of their favorite story.

Shifting gears to a recent criminal case, a Vietnamese food store owner in Osaka has been arrested for allegedly using fraudulent smartphone payments to swindle approximately 10 million yen from credit card companies. The suspect repeatedly made fictitious transactions using someone else's smartphone and took advantage of NTT Docomo's electronic payment service, 'd-Pay.' The investigation by the Osaka Prefectural Police reveals the growing concern over digital fraud and the need for robust security measures.

In technology news, the Mainichi Shimbun, one of Japan's leading newspapers, has launched an English news app specifically designed for Apple's latest product, the 'Apple Vision Pro.' The app provides English-language articles from 'The Mainichi' for users of this cutting-edge device, catering to the growing demand for convenient access to news in multiple languages.

And finally, an update on the ongoing investigation into fraudulent 'd-Pay' transactions. The Osaka Prefectural Police, along with the International Investigation Division, have arrested a group of Vietnamese individuals in their 20s and 30s residing in Osaka and Hyogo. The group is suspected of using other people's smartphones to carry out fraudulent transactions, resulting in the theft of more than 20 million yen. The investigation, which began in May of last year, aims to uncover the full extent of the fraudulent activities and bring those responsible to justice.
