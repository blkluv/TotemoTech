### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 1st, 2023. In today's news, Pokémon GO players have a new tool to enhance their gaming experience. Niantic, the company behind Pokémon GO, has announced the release of a social app called 'Campfire' that is now available to all trainers. This app offers several useful features, especially for raid battles.

Moving on to our next story, the Digital Agency in Japan has taken action to rectify a mistake made in registering public fund accounts. The agency has sent letters to individuals who may have mistakenly registered accounts that are not in their own names, requesting them to change or delete the registered accounts.

Next up, a major blunder has occurred at Tokyo Institute of Technology. It has been revealed that the university accidentally sent an email to students with personal information of approximately 10,000 individuals attached. The university has acknowledged the mistake and issued a statement regarding the incident.

In other news, Skeb, a company based in Tokyo, has taken legal action against an article that explains methods to bypass their AI illustration detection system. Skeb has filed a lawsuit demanding the disclosure of the identity of the article's author and plans to seek compensation for damages.

Moving on, we have an appointment to announce. Mr. Jōichi Ito has been appointed as the president of Chiba Institute of Technology. In his statement, Mr. Ito expressed his commitment to addressing the issue of the shortage of engineers in Japan and further improving the social status of engineers.

In the world of entertainment, TV Tokyo is venturing into the world of AI virtual YouTubers. They are launching a new project in which users who have purchased NFTs can use ChatGPT to create personalities and profiles for their virtual characters, who will then host YouTube programs and other content.

Shifting gears, the Electricity and Gas Transaction Monitoring Committee has issued a recommendation for business improvement to Grande Data, a new power supplier. The committee found that the company's notifications were insufficient and that they had used misleading websites for solicitation.

And finally, we have an update on the ongoing system failure at M.K. System, the provider of the cloud service 'Sharo Yume' for labor and social security consultants. The company has revised its projected consolidated financial results for the fiscal year ending in March 2024. Due to the system failures, the expected revenue of approximately 3.2 billion yen and the projected operating profit of 260 million yen have both been marked as 'undetermined'.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
