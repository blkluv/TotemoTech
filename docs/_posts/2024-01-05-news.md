In other news, the space venture company, Axelspace, has released satellite images of the areas affected by the earthquake in Rikuzentakata City, Nanao City, Takaoka City, and other areas in Ishikawa and Toyama Prefectures. The images are available for free to the government and media organizations. Moving on, the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan has announced that there was a maximum crustal displacement of 3 meters in the western part of Wajima City due to the earthquake that occurred on January 1st. Furthermore, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism has implemented a 'drone flight ban' across the entire Noto Peninsula to ensure it does not hinder manned helicopter activities such as search and rescue operations.
