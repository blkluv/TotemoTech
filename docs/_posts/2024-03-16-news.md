Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on March 16th, 2024. In today's news, Nissan and Honda have announced a strategic partnership to explore the electrification and intelligence of cars. The two Japanese automakers aim to leverage scale advantages to compete against rivals in this rapidly evolving industry.

Moving on, let's talk about Fujifilm. As the world's leading film company, Fujifilm surprised everyone by being an early pioneer in the digital camera market. Despite its dominance in the film industry, Fujifilm was quick to embrace digital photography, setting the stage for its success in the digital camera market.

Next, we have a story involving 'atwiki,' the operator of the 'AniotaWiki (tentative)' website. Atwiki has issued an apology for problematic advertisements on the AniotaWiki site. The advertisements embedded by the site's administrator caused antivirus software to react, creating a stir among users.

Shifting gears, let's talk about McDonald's. The fast-food giant has temporarily closed multiple stores in Japan, and its official app is experiencing technical difficulties. While the company has not provided any official explanation for the closures, some speculate that it may be related to the ongoing issues with the app, which has been unable to process mobile orders and other features.

In other news, Fujitsu, a leading Japanese IT company, has announced that several of its business PCs have been infected with malware. This has put personal and customer information at risk of being illicitly accessed. Fujitsu has already taken measures to isolate the affected PCs and is currently investigating the breach.

Lastly, we have another McDonald's-related story. The official McDonald's app is experiencing a service disruption, affecting mobile ordering and delivery services at select locations. Customers using the app on iOS and Android are unable to access these features at certain stores.
