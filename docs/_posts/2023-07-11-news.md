### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 11th, 2023. In today's news, LINE Group has obtained permission to develop an NFT game using Sega's intellectual property. The game will be available on LINE Group's NFT game platform called 'GAME DOSI.' This move aims to leverage the popularity of NFTs and Sega's iconic characters to attract gamers.

Next, Ricoh, the Japanese multinational imaging and electronics company, has developed a no-code development tool that allows companies to create their own AI models. With this tool, users can simply upload an Excel file and the AI model will be trained to learn specific words and phrases related to the company. This tool simplifies the process of AI model creation and enables businesses to harness the power of AI without extensive coding knowledge.

Moving on, there seems to be a dispute within the 5ch community. JaneStyle, one of the largest browsers for accessing the popular Japanese anonymous message board 5ch, has cut ties with 5ch and introduced a new browser exclusively for the mysterious bulletin board called 'Talk.' This change has left users confused and uncertain about the future of their online community.

In other news, UUUM, a major Japanese multi-channel network, has revised its performance forecast for the fiscal year ending in May 2023. The downward revision is attributed to the significant increase in the number of views for YouTube Shorts, a feature on the video-sharing platform. This unexpected surge in views has impacted UUUM's projected financial performance.

Additionally, the list of games for the upcoming 'RTA in Japan Summer 2023' event has been revealed. The event will feature speedruns of popular games, including 'Tokimeki Memorial: Forever With You' and 'The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,' where participants attempt time attacks while blindfolded. This unique challenge adds an exciting twist to the traditional speedrunning competitions.

In the world of social media, Meta's new social networking service called 'Threads' has surpassed 100 million users just five days after its launch on July 6th. This impressive milestone demonstrates the strong demand for new social media platforms and Meta's ability to attract users.

Furthermore, the highly anticipated 'Amazon Prime Day' sale is set to begin on July 11th. The sale, organized by Amazon Japan, offers discounted prices on a wide range of products, including Amazon's original devices like the 'Amazon Echo,' as well as digital appliances, gadgets, and everyday essentials. The sale will run until July 12th, but a pre-sale with select items at Prime Day prices has already started on July 9th.

Lastly, as the summer heat intensifies, smartphones are facing challenges with overheating. The rising temperatures have been causing the device's operating temperature to exceed safe levels. To understand the impact of overheating on smartphones, we reached out to Sharp, a leading electronics manufacturer. They shed light on the potential consequences of excessive heat on smartphone performance and shared insights on how to mitigate these issues.

That concludes today's news from TotemoTech. Stay tuned for more updates on the latest technology trends and developments.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
