### Transcript

Welcome to TotemoTech on April 21st. Let's start with some space news. Yesterday, SpaceX conducted a test flight of its largest rocket, the Starship. However, the rocket failed to separate from the booster and had to be destroyed mid-flight. 

Moving on to consumer electronics, Panasonic has announced that some of its clothes dryers sold since 2003 may pose a fire hazard. The company is offering to pay owners between 10,000 to 20,000 yen to take back the affected products or replace them for free. 

In other news, Square, the company behind the popular payment service, has launched a new feature that turns Android phones into credit card payment terminals. The service is currently available in several countries, including the US and the UK, but not yet in Japan.
