### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on May 19th, 2024. In today's news, we have two significant stories to discuss. First, Square Enix, the renowned game developer, has been facing financial difficulties. Their recent financial report did not meet market expectations, leading to a decline in their stock prices. Last year, Square Enix released several titles, including a new installment in the Final Fantasy series. However, the online reviews of their games were somewhat harsh. This has raised concerns among gaming enthusiasts and industry experts about the company's future prospects.

Moving on to our second story, LINE, the popular messaging app, has issued a warning regarding a new method of account takeover. Scammers are using pets as a pretext to deceive LINE users into giving away their account information. They send direct messages on other social media platforms, asking users to vote for their 'cute' pets and redirecting them to a fake login page. Once users enter their authentication details, the scammers gain access to their accounts. LINE has urged its users to stay vigilant and be cautious of such tactics.

That's all for today's news from TotemoTech. Stay tuned for more updates on the latest tech happenings.   Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
