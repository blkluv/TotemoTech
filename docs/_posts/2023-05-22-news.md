### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on May 22nd, 2023. The Japanese Ministry of Education's research agency has acknowledged that their predictions for the future of science and technology were too focused on technology itself and not enough on the human element. To address this, they have turned to science fiction for inspiration on how to envision a more human-centered society. Meanwhile, Pokémon GO players can look forward to a new community day featuring the rare color variation of the Pokémon Fennekin. In other gaming news, the popular creator support sites pixivFANBOX and DLsite have temporarily banned AI-generated illustrations, causing concern among manga artists. On the topic of Pokémon, the app Pokémon HOME will soon be compatible with Pokémon Sword and Shield, allowing players to transfer their Pokémon between games. In tech industry news, Fujitsu has apologized for issues with their convenience store service and pledged to take steps to prevent future problems. Additionally, news outlet Game*Spark has announced plans to remove in-article network ads in response to reader complaints. Finally, Takara Tomy has released a new digital pet toy called Kyubittsu, which responds to touch and appears to float on the screen.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
