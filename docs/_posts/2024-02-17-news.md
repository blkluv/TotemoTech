Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on February 17th, 2024. In today's news, OpenAI's video generation AI called 'Sora' is making waves with its ability to create 'fake videos' that mimic popular games like Minecraft. Users are amazed by the high quality of these AI-generated videos, which can be created with just a prompt and last up to one minute.

Moving on to our next story, the popular game 'Watermelon Game' is set to release its first official merchandise. The merchandise includes stickers featuring the iconic 'Watermelon Game' logo and will be sold at 'GiGO's Taiyaki Main Store'. This move aims to combat counterfeit products and provide fans with authentic merchandise.
