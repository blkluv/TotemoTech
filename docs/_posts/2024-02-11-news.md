In a concerning development, a male employee of a real estate sales company, identified as Kazuma Kataoka, has been arrested for allegedly gaining unauthorized access to the corporate business card management system 'Sansan' and viewing the information.

Meanwhile, in response to the Noto Peninsula earthquake in Reiwa 6, the editorial department of Shueisha's 'Weekly Shonen Jump' has decided to offer free access to four issues of the magazine and other publications through their own app. The aim is to reach readers in areas affected by the delayed distribution and inability to release the magazine.
