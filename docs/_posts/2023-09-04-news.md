Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on September 4th, 2023. In today's news, we have two significant stories to discuss.

First, there has been a system failure on Yahoo! Auctions, the popular auction service by Yahoo. Since around 10 p.m. on September 3rd, users have been experiencing difficulties with bidding and making payments after winning auctions. The official notice page of the service acknowledges the issue, stating that accessing Yahoo! Auctions is currently challenging. This system failure is causing inconvenience for users who rely on the platform for buying and selling items.

Moving on to our second story, NHK is airing a two-part special titled 'NHK Special: Visual Records - The Great Kanto Earthquake: Three Days of Tokyo's Destruction.' The documentary, which started on September 2nd at 10 p.m., provides a vivid account of the devastating Great Kanto Earthquake that occurred 100 years ago. By scanning and colorizing the original footage using 8K and AI technology, the program reveals previously unknown details such as the locations and timings of the recordings. The Chief Producer of NHK shares the technological aspects and intentions behind the production of this program.
