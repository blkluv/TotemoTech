### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on November 7th, 2023. In today's news, PFU, the company behind the popular 'Happy Hacking Keyboard' or HHKB, has launched a new venture called 'HHKB Studio' with two significant changes. They have introduced new key switches and added two major features. The move aims to attract a new user base and has sparked mixed reactions among enthusiasts. Switching gears, let's take a look at the desk environments of IT professionals. Sony Biz Networks, the company behind 'NURO Biz' and 'Prediction One,' is showcasing the workspaces of engineers and salespeople. The photo series provides insights into the working conditions and tools used by employees. Moving on, a Japanese development company called Future Eye has filed a lawsuit against Amazon, alleging patent infringement by the AI assistant 'Alexa.' This is not the first time Future Eye has taken legal action against a tech giant, as they previously won a lawsuit against LINE. Shifting focus, as we enter the winter season, smartphone battery replacement issues are on the rise. The fluctuating temperatures affect battery performance, leading to faster drainage and heating. Repair companies are reporting an increase in battery replacement requests, cautioning users to be mindful of the impact of cold weather on their devices. On the cybersecurity front, the ongoing conflict in Gaza has escalated into a cyber battle. Hacker groups aligned with pro-Palestinian, pro-Russia, and pro-Iran ideologies are intensifying cyber attacks on Israel. Notably, they are targeting Western countries supporting Israel's right to self-defense and Japan, which has been collaborating with Israel on cybersecurity efforts. This cyber warfare raises concerns about the potential implications for the conflict. Shifting gears once again, VR talent agency 'Iwamotocho Entertainment' has announced its bankruptcy and closure. The agency managed virtual idols such as 'Enogu' and 'Marpril.' Finally, a rumor about LINE connectivity issues in November has caused a stir. While it was initially speculated that LINE would become inaccessible if users didn't agree to the new privacy policy by the end of October, this turned out to be false. The confusion stemmed from a message received by a concerned mother, who was relieved to learn that her LINE usage would not be affected. That wraps up today's news from TotemoTech. Stay tuned for more updates on the latest tech developments.   Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
