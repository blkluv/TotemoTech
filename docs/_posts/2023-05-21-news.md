### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on May 21st, 2023. Japanese carmaker Daihatsu has announced that it has found irregularities in the certification process for pole side collision tests for two of its domestic models and has suspended production and sales of the affected vehicles. Meanwhile, Honda has announced the launch of a new low-cost electric bike model for general consumers in Japan, which features a battery-swapping system. In other news, a recent survey by NTT Docomo has found that the percentage of children who can type on a keyboard has caught up with those who can use mobile phones for text input. Fujitsu has also announced measures to improve system quality and information security in response to a series of recent incidents, while IT vendor IJC has been blamed for two cases of mistaken issuance of registration certificates for seal impressions in Imabari City, Ehime Prefecture. In addition, GMO GlobalSign's TLS/SSL server certificate service experienced a malfunction due to a simultaneous failure of its load balancer, and US-based Swimlane has launched its SOAR product line in Japan. Finally, a survey by PwC Consulting has found that over half of respondents are not familiar with generative AI.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
