Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on August 31st, 2023. Yahoo! Japan has recently introduced a trading card authentication service on its auction site, Yahoo! Auctions. This new service aims to verify the authenticity of trading cards, including popular ones like Pokémon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, and Magic: The Gathering.

In other news, Mizuho Bank's email with the subject line 'Important and Urgent: Restriction on Deposits and Withdrawals' has caused quite a stir. Despite its appearance as a scam email, it was actually sent by Mizuho Bank itself. We delve into the reasons behind this unusual email and what led to its circulation.

Moving on, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in Japan has issued an administrative guidance to Yahoo! Japan. It was discovered that Yahoo! Japan had been providing location information to South Korean company NAVER without adequately informing its users. Furthermore, NAVER was found to have insufficient security measures in place to protect the information received.

In retail news, department store giants Sogo-Seibu have announced the temporary closure of their Ikebukuro flagship store in response to a strike by their labor union.

Moving on to the world of broadcasting, Panasonic's IP switcher, KAIROS, has received a powerful new update. This software-based IP switcher revolutionizes video processing for switching purposes. In addition to its existing features, the new update includes the ability to transform a touch panel PC into an operational console, further enhancing its functionality.

Lastly, PayPay, a popular mobile payment service in Japan, has launched the 'PayPay Point Up Store' program. Participating stores can offer additional points to PayPay users based on their own unique conditions. For example, some stores may offer an extra 1% in points on Mondays. This initiative aims to incentivize customers to shop at these designated stores and earn more PayPay points.
