Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on December 16th, 2023. In today's news, Tiger Magic Bottle has issued a warning about the popular 'rice cooker recipes' that have been gaining popularity on video streaming and recipe websites. They have highlighted the potential dangers of using the rice cooker incorrectly, leading to malfunctions and injuries.

Moving on to our next story, AI venture PKSHA Technology has announced the development of an AI system that can predict the likelihood of children becoming school absentees. This technology aims to identify early warning signs and provide support to prevent school absences.

Now let's talk about the latest release from Don Quijote, the discount store chain. They have launched a new laptop called 'MUGA5' priced at 43,780 yen. The MUGA5 features an Intel N100 CPU and promises to address previous issues of slow performance and screen freezing.

Next up, we have an interesting case study involving ChatGPT. Despite achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 94%, the city of Mitoyo in Kagawa Prefecture decided not to utilize ChatGPT for their 'garbage disposal guidance' service. The collaboration between Mitoyo City and the Matsuo Lab aimed to streamline operations using AI, but they were unable to achieve the desired results. Let's explore the reasons behind this decision.

Shifting gears, Sony has announced a new addition to the 'KidZania Koshien' theme park. Starting from March, they will introduce a 'video creator' profession in their 'video production studio' pavilion, allowing children to experience the world of video production.

In an interesting development, researchers from the Wariwaza Laboratory at the University of Tokyo have proposed a wearable haptic device that can simulate the sensation of wind blowing against your sleeves. By inducing vibrations, the device creates the feeling of being buffeted by strong winds, providing a unique sensory experience.

Lastly, a group of researchers from Rutgers University has proposed a new eavesdropping attack that can capture 'room voices' by detecting the minute vibrations caused by human speech using millimeter-wave devices. This technique allows them to reconstruct the captured vibrations and retrieve the spoken words, potentially compromising privacy and security.

That concludes today's news from TotemoTech. Stay tuned for more exciting updates in the world of technology.   Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
