### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on June 14th, 2023. Today, we have a variety of tech news from Japan. First up, with the rainy season upon us, we have some tips for drying clothes indoors to avoid musty smells. Discord is also making changes, allowing users to refresh their usernames and remove identification tags. Google search has an Easter egg that causes the internet to break when searching for "Katamari Damacy." Pixiv has added a reporting function to their "BOOTH" sales page to report inappropriate content such as excessive sexual content or copyright infringement. A Japanese startup, Monoxer, which provides AI-based digital teaching materials, has been featured in an article showcasing the desk environments of its employees. A survey of Japanese workers earning over 6.5 million yen per year has revealed the top three companies they would like to work for, with Google coming in third, Sony in second, and the first place remaining a mystery. Finally, Livedoor News has released a beta version of an AI summarization tool called "Zakkuri Pon," which generates three-line summaries of news articles.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
