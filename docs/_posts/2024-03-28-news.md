### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on March 28th, 2024. In today's news, we have two significant stories to discuss.

First, there is a concerning trend of 'death scams' and 'obituary pirates' taking advantage of people's deaths for clickbait and spreading fake obituaries. These issues, known as '死別詐欺' and '訃報海賊' in Japanese, have become a problem on the internet. It's important to be cautious and verify the authenticity of any news related to someone's death.

Next, there has been a recent controversy surrounding the popular website 'DLsite' and its expression changes. In response to a request from credit card brands, DLsite announced modifications to certain phrases. However, it was revealed on March 27th that further revisions will be made to the changed expressions. This development has sparked discussions and reactions among users of the website.

Moving on to another news story, a survey conducted by the Japan Animation Film Culture Association (NAFCA) reveals that the median working hours in the anime industry, including animators, amount to 225 hours per month. This sheds light on the demanding workload faced by professionals in the anime industry.

Shifting gears, the term 'ひよこババア' (hiyoko babaa) has unexpectedly become a trending topic. This follows DLsite's announcement regarding expression changes, which caught attention on social media platforms. It's interesting to see how certain words can become trends and generate discussions.

In international news, there have been concerns over the use of Chinese company logos in documents presented at conferences and meetings. The issue initially arose when a task force within the Japanese Cabinet Office, aiming to revise regulations for renewable energy, included documents with watermarked logos of Chinese state-owned enterprises. It has now come to light that similar materials with Chinese company logos were used in meetings of United Nations and European Union-related organizations. This situation raises questions about potential misinterpretations and the need for better verification processes.

Furthermore, Nintendo has publicly shared its perspective on talent acquisition. The company has published a webpage titled 'Nintendo's Approach to Human Resources,' where they discuss their management policies, development philosophies, and efforts in nurturing talent. It provides insights into the type of individuals sought after by this global entertainment company.

Lastly, Sumitomo Realty is taking steps towards creating a 'Kyoto version of Silicon Valley.' On April 1st, an incubation office supporting entrepreneurs will open at the commercial facility 'Kyoto Kawaramachi Garden.' The office aims to provide affordable rental spaces and offer services tailored to the unique characteristics of Kyoto as a city known for its student population. By supporting business attraction and talent acquisition, Sumitomo Realty aims to address the issue of young people leaving Kyoto, a challenge specific to the city.
