### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on April 30th, 2024. In today's news, FujiFilm has developed an interesting camera called the INSTAX mini 99. What makes it unique is that it reminds us that 'photography is all about light,' a concept that has been forgotten for a long time.

Moving on to our next story, the 'Great Kaiji Exhibition' at Tokyo Dome City is creating quite a stir. If you're looking for something to do during Golden Week, why not visit this exhibition? As soon as you enter the venue, you'll be greeted by a tense atmosphere that will surely captivate you.

Next up, Sharp has released its first-ever circulator, which is capable of circulating air in a 30-tatami-mat room while remaining quiet. The circulator features a newly developed fan inspired by the shape of an owl's wings, allowing for both high airflow and noise reduction. It took Sharp over three years to develop this product, which can be easily disassembled for cleaning and is equipped with Plasmacluster NEXT to eliminate damp odors from laundry. We had the opportunity to speak with a representative from Sharp who was involved in the development.

In other news, Evernote, under the umbrella of Bending Spoons, announced that despite the dissolution of its Japanese subsidiary, Japanese customers can continue to use Evernote as usual. The official announcement was made on their X account (formerly Twitter) on April 27th. The dissolution of Evernote Japan was also published in the official gazette on the same day.

Moving on, Epic Games has released RealityCapture 1.4, a photogrammetry software that allows users to construct 3D spaces based on multiple images and laser scan data. The new version introduces a revamped pricing system, offering free access to individuals and businesses with annual revenues below $1 million. This update provides an opportunity for more users to explore the possibilities of photogrammetry.

Next, Seven-Eleven Japan has expanded its test of QR code scanning microwaves in 1080 stores in the Tokai region. By scanning the QR code on the product label with the microwave's camera, the wattage and heating time are automatically set. Both Seven-Eleven and Sharp plan to continue expanding the implementation of this technology in more stores.

And finally, TV Tokyo announced that it will be streaming the legendary anime 'Maicching Machiko-sensei' from the 1980s on platforms such as TVer. The show will be streamed in its original form, respecting its uniqueness and preserving the nostalgic charm of the original broadcast.

That's all for today's news from TotemoTech. Thank you for listening!   Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
