Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 12th, 2023. In today's news, we have some interesting stories from the world of technology. First up, the newly released social networking site 'Threads' is facing a spam problem. Since its launch on July 6th, numerous spam posts have been reported on the platform. Users are advised to be cautious and not fall for any phishing attempts or provide personal information.

Moving on to our next story, tech enthusiasts will be delighted to know that the 'Pixel 7' smartphone is currently on sale at the 'Google Store'. Starting from July 7th, the summer sale offers a special price for the latest models, including the 'Pixel 7/7 Pro' and the 'Google Pixel Watch'. This sale will continue until July 17th, so it's a great opportunity to get your hands on these cutting-edge devices.

Next, we have an update from 'pixivFANBOX'. On July 25th, the platform will be implementing revised guidelines regarding AI-generated artwork. The new rules explicitly prohibit the posting of AI-generated content and any attempts to redirect users to external sites. This move aims to maintain the integrity and quality of the platform's content.

In other news, a recent survey conducted by Dell Technologies reveals an interesting finding about gamers' preferences when buying a gaming PC. Contrary to popular belief, the survey shows that the most important factor for gamers is not the GPU (graphics processing unit), but something else. While the exact top priority is not mentioned, this finding challenges the assumption that GPU is the sole determining factor for gamers.

Shifting our focus to a non-tech story, the National Land Survey of Japan has released estimated flood maps for the heavy rainfall that occurred in Kyushu from June 29th. These maps, based on data captured by disaster response helicopters, provide valuable information on the depth of flooding in affected areas. This can aid in disaster preparedness and response efforts.

This device enhances the gameplay experience by allowing players to choose the type of Poké Ball they want to throw. Pre-orders are available on select e-commerce sites, such as Amazon.

The full text can be accessed on the publisher's website until the 16th of July.

And finally, get ready for an augmented reality invasion as Taito Corporation announces the global release of the AR location-based game 'Space Invader World Defense' on July 18th.
