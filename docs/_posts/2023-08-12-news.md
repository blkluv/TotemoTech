### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on August 12th, 2023. In today's news, we have two significant stories to discuss.

First, let's talk about the rise of 'Vertical SaaS' in low IT budget markets. Japanese startups specializing in 'Vertical SaaS' have been experiencing growth even in markets with limited IT budgets. We spoke to vendors to uncover the key factors behind this success.

Moving on to our second story, we have a new type of earphone that is gaining attention. It's called 'cartilage conduction,' and it's part of the 'earphones that don't block your ears' category. These earphones have been capturing the interest of a wide range of users since the summer of 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic began. While bone conduction earphones have been available for some time, a new type called 'cartilage conduction' has recently emerged. We'll delve into what makes these earphones unique.

That's it for today's news. Stay tuned for more updates from TotemoTech.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
