Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on December 18th, 2023. In today's news, we have two interesting stories to share. First, let's talk about an issue that some Tesla owners have been experiencing. It's called the 'Phantom Brake.' Owners have reported instances where the car's automatic emergency braking system activates unexpectedly, even when there is no obstacle in front of the vehicle. This has led to some scary situations on the roads. Tesla has been working to address this issue and ensure the safety of their customers.

Next, we have some surprising news from the movie industry. The film 'GeGeGe no Nazo,' a prequel to the popular anime 'GeGeGe no Kitaro,' has become a hit through word-of-mouth. It has surpassed 1.15 billion yen in box office revenue and has gained popularity among female audiences. The movie explores the backstory of the beloved character 'Kitaro' and has captivated audiences with its unique storytelling.

Moving on to our other news stories, the manga series 'Yu Yu Hakusho' by Yoshihiro Togashi is now available for free on the e-book store 'Zebulack.' Fans of the series can enjoy reading all 153 chapters for a limited time. This release is in celebration of the upcoming live-action drama adaptation of the manga.

In a safety-related announcement, Tiger Corporation, known for its rice cookers, has issued a warning regarding popular 'rice cooker recipes' that have been circulating on video and recipe websites. They have highlighted the potential dangers of using the rice cooker incorrectly, which can lead to malfunctions and even injuries. Users are urged to follow proper guidelines when using their rice cookers.

In the field of artificial intelligence, PKSHA Technology, an AI venture, has announced the development of an AI system that can predict the likelihood of children becoming truant. This AI aims to provide early intervention and support for at-risk students, helping to prevent school absenteeism.

On the tech front, Don Quijote, a popular discount store chain, has released a new budget-friendly laptop called 'MUGA5.' Priced at 43,780 yen, this laptop features an Intel N100 CPU and promises improved performance and stability, addressing previous issues of lag and screen freezes.

Lastly, let's talk about an interesting experiment conducted by the city of Mitoyo and the Matsuo Lab. They attempted to use ChatGPT, a language model, to automate the task of garbage disposal guidance. However, despite achieving a 94% accuracy rate, the city decided not to implement the AI system due to unforeseen challenges. The experiment did not yield the expected results, and the reasons behind this decision are still being analyzed.
