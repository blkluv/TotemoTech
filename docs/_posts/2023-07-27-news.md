### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 27th, 2023. South Korean tech giant, Samsung Electronics, has announced the launch of its latest foldable smartphones, the Galaxy Z Fold5 and Galaxy Z Flip5. These new devices are thinner, lighter, and have no gap when closed. Pre-orders have already begun in select markets, with the official release scheduled for August 11th.

In other news, Nissan has finalized its partnership with Renault Group, including an equal mutual investment ratio of 15%. As part of this collaboration, Nissan will contribute up to 600 million euros (approximately 93.3 billion yen) to Renault's new EV venture in Europe. This partnership aims to strengthen their presence in Latin America, India, and the European market.

Moving on, Tokyo's Tokyu Corporation has announced a new paid seat reservation service called 'Q SEAT' on the Toyoko Line. Starting from August 10th, passengers will be able to reserve seats for a fee, avoiding the busiest hours and providing a more comfortable travel experience, particularly during weekdays after 7:30 PM.

In the tech world, the recently rebranded 'X' logo, formerly known as Twitter, has already received an update. The revised version features a slightly bolder font weight, significantly changing the impression of the unbordered parts of the logo. Despite the change, CEO Jack Dorsey has expressed intentions to revert to the original design.

Shifting gears to the gaming industry, CyberAgent has reported a loss of 100 million yen in its game business for the third quarter of the fiscal year ending in September 2023 (April to June). The company attributes the decline in profitability to a significant decrease in revenue from high-profit games. This marks the first loss since the success of the 'Uma Musume' game.

In the world of audio technology, cheero's 'Otocarti LITE' earphones, which utilize the 'cartilage conduction' method, have gained attention for their suitability in remote work settings. These earphones lightly touch the ears without blocking the ear canal, allowing for minimal discomfort. Ultimately, the sound is transmitted through the eardrums, resulting in a more natural audio experience.

Lastly, NHK has announced the resumption of streaming popular dramas, including the historical drama 'Kamakura-dono no 13-nin' and the series 'Kishibe Rohan wa Ugokanai.' These shows will be available on NHK's paid video-on-demand service, 'NHK On Demand,' after a temporary suspension due to the alleged involvement of actor Ichikawa Sarunoshin in a criminal case.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
