### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on September 16th, 2023. In today's news, we have two interesting stories to share. First, let's talk about the latest food trend in Japan. Onigiri, a traditional rice ball, has been gaining popularity recently. Specialized onigiri shops are popping up all over the country, with long queues forming outside. Taking advantage of this trend, Takara Tomy Arts has introduced the 'Ultimate Onigiri' maker, which allows you to easily create fluffy onigiri similar to those found in popular onigiri specialty stores. To find out what makes it different from regular onigiri, a professional chef from a renowned restaurant tried it out. The results were impressive, and the chef was amazed by the professional techniques used to enhance the taste.

Moving on to sports news, DAZN, a popular sports streaming platform, announced that the live broadcast of the game where the Hanshin Tigers secured their league championship on September 14th has become the most-watched baseball content of the season on their platform. This achievement places it as the second most-watched baseball event in DAZN's history. It's clear that fans were excited to witness this historic moment.

Next, let's talk about a fun feature that is making waves on social media. The 'Emoji Kitchen' feature, which allows users to mix two emojis to create new ones, is gaining popularity. Originally available on Google search, it has now become a hit on X (formerly known as Twitter), with users posting chaotic combinations of emojis. It's a creative way to express emotions and add some fun to conversations.

In other news, the winners of the 2023 Ig Nobel Prize have been announced, but let's not forget about the unique research articles that could be potential candidates for the next Ig Nobel Prize. We'll highlight five interesting studies, including a VR experience that simulates the sensation of bugs crawling in your mouth, an AI system that diagnoses diarrhea, and a bag clip that plays the sound of burping. These quirky research projects showcase the diversity of scientific exploration.

Moving on, ASKUL, a B2B online shopping service, will be raising its shipping fees starting from October 31st. The company states that this change aims to improve working conditions in the logistics field. While this might inconvenience some customers, ASKUL hopes that it will contribute to a better working environment for their employees.

In the world of transportation, Honda has announced the revival of the iconic 'Motocompo' as an electric bike called 'Motocompact.' This compact electric bike, reminiscent of the original Motocompo, has been unveiled in the United States. Honda aims to provide a convenient and eco-friendly mode of transportation for urban dwellers.

Lastly, we have news regarding a data breach. Mazda has reported a possible unauthorized access to their internal servers, which may have resulted in the leakage of over 100,000 personal records. The company has issued an apology and is taking the necessary steps to address the situation. Data security remains a critical concern in today's digital age.
