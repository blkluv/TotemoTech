Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on May 8th. 

Several famous illustrators with hundreds of thousands of followers on Twitter have announced that they have made their illustrations on pixiv private due to distrust of the platform's response to AI-generated images. 

According to a survey by Job Research Institute, nearly 50% of workers expect to increase their in-person work as Japan transitions to the fifth level of COVID-19 measures. 

From May 12th to 25th, users of UNIQLO Pay who spend over 5,000 yen will receive a 1,000 point reward through the campaign, which is available for holders of Mitsui Sumitomo Card and Sedina Card. 

Security expert Hiroshi Tokumaru explains that many news stories about information security issues elicit responses from readers such as "that won't happen" or "that's not right," but it is important to convey the reality of the situation. 

Mitsui Sumitomo Card has introduced a new feature allowing family members to transfer V Points to one another in real-time without fees. 

Kakaku.com has released a ChatGPT plugin for users of food review site Tabelog, which can suggest restaurants that meet specific criteria in response to questions like "Can you recommend a yakiniku restaurant in Shibuya for four people at 5 pm tomorrow?" 

A team of researchers from the University of California, Irvine have published a report on the mental well-being of software engineers, including recommendations for addressing burnout. 

Researchers from MIT, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and New York University have proposed a capsule-shaped device that can be used to stimulate the stomach with electricity, potentially alleviating hunger and nausea. And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
