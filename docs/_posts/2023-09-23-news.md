### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on September 23rd, 2023. In today's news, we have some interesting stories from the world of technology.

First up, Balmy Bites. Balmyuda, known for their popular fans and toasters, has announced a new product called 'BALMUDA The Plate Pro.' This hot plate aims to provide a unique culinary experience by allowing users to cut and eat grilled meat right on the plate. We spoke to the developers to learn more about the inspiration behind this innovative device.

Next, we have an unconventional keyboard called 'GrabShell.' This keyboard allows users to grip it and type, offering a completely different typing experience. We got our hands on this peculiar keyboard and tested it out to see who it might be suitable for.

Moving on to smartphones, the iPhone 15 has been released in China. Despite reports of strong pre-orders, the launch faced headwinds as the Chinese government banned the use of foreign smartphones for official purposes. Additionally, local Chinese manufacturers are gearing up to compete in the market. It will be interesting to see how the iPhone 15 performs in this challenging environment.

In other news, GMO Internet Group has appointed Professor Yutaka Matsuo from the University of Tokyo as their new advisor. Professor Matsuo, renowned for his work in AI research, is expected to accelerate the company's utilization of artificial intelligence.

Shifting gears, a notorious YouTuber known for provocative content, Johnny Somari, also known as Ismael Ramsey Khalid, was arrested by Osaka Prefectural Police for illegally trespassing a construction site in Osaka. The police have taken a firm stance against crossing the line and will not tolerate such behavior.

Next, let's talk about gaming furniture. At the Tokyo Game Show, Nitori showcased their 'gaming furniture' and soundproof rooms, which have gained popularity due to the increased demand for home entertainment during the pandemic. Various exhibitors have reported a surge in interest and sales.

And finally, we have the collaboration between Topre and the popular game 'Umamusume: Pretty Derby.' We spoke directly to Topre to uncover the reasons behind this unique collaboration between a keyboard manufacturer and a horse racing game.

That wraps up today's news. Stay tuned for more exciting updates from the world of technology.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
