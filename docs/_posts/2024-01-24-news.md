Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on January 24th, 2024. In today's news, we have some interesting stories from Japan.

First up, an online liquor store called KURAND has released a new sake called 'Source Code' specifically targeted at system engineers. What makes this sake unique is that it has a hidden message on its label in the form of source code. It's a clever way to combine the worlds of technology and traditional Japanese culture.

Moving on to entertainment news, fans of the popular stop-motion animation series 'PUI PUI Molcar' will be excited to hear that a new full-length CG movie is set to be released later this year. This is a departure from the previous stop-motion style and will showcase the cute and lovable Molcars in a new animated format.

Next, the National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan has issued a warning regarding cryptocurrency investment scams. They have received numerous complaints from people in their 20s who were lured into investing in cryptocurrencies by individuals they met on social media. These victims found themselves unable to withdraw their funds, highlighting the importance of being cautious when engaging in cryptocurrency investments.

In technology news, NTT Docomo has announced a price revision for its sports video streaming service, 'DAZN for docomo.' Starting from March 1st, the monthly subscription fee will be increased from 1,925 yen to 3,000 yen. This change will affect both new and existing users, and it aims to reflect the rising costs of providing high-quality sports content.

In other media-related news, Japan Multimedia Broadcasting, the operator of V-Low Multimedia Broadcasting 'i-dio,' has been ordered to undergo special liquidation by the Tokyo District Court. The company faced a debt of 4.7 billion yen, leading to this unfortunate outcome.

Shifting gears to tourism, the beloved aquarium 'Awashima Marine Park' in Numazu City, known as one of the pilgrimage sites for the anime 'Love Live! Sunshine!!,' will be closing its doors on February 12th. The decision to close the park was made due to the aging facilities, but it leaves behind a legacy as a cherished location for fans of the anime.

Lastly, let's talk about AI governance. On December 9th, 2023, the European Union announced a provisional political agreement on the 'AI Act.' This regulation aims to govern the use of artificial intelligence within the EU. Various analyses have been conducted to assess the potential impact of this legislation, including the calculation of costs associated with implementing AI governance. Some experts estimate that companies may experience a 40% decrease in profits due to the expenses involved.
