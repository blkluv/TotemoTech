Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on February 4th, 2024. In today's news, we have some interesting stories from the world of technology and gaming.

First up, there's a new game called 'Sujimon Battle' that has caught the attention of manga artists who are fans of the popular 'Yakuza' series. This game, developed by Sega as a mini-game in 'Yakuza 8', features elements similar to Pokémon. It seems like there's no shortage of games inspired by the beloved pocket monsters!

Moving on to photography, Ricoh has reintroduced the casual outdoor camera 'WG-90' under the Pentax brand. This camera is dustproof, waterproof, shockproof, and can withstand low temperatures. It even comes with a handy 'microscope mode' for those who want to explore the tiny details of nature. It's great to see Pentax making a comeback in the camera market!

Next, let's talk about keyboards. The first-ever self-made keyboard flea market in Japan, called 'Keyboard Market Tokyo', is generating excitement among keyboard enthusiasts. The event, scheduled for the near future, will showcase a wide range of keyboards, from high-quality models to quirky macro pads. Whether you're a professional typist or just enjoy the feel of a unique keyboard, this event is definitely worth checking out!

Shifting gears to video editing, the Japanese-born professional video editing software 'EDIUS' has released a new version with enhanced capabilities for small-scale workflows. While Avid's 'Media Composer' may be more well-known globally, EDIUS has a strong user base in Japan. It's always fascinating to see how different software tools dominate various regions!

In the world of virtual reality, Meta's XR headset series, 'Meta Quest', is receiving an update that allows users to play spatial videos captured with iPhones. With the latest 'v62' version, Meta Quest users can immerse themselves in a whole new dimension of content. This integration of hardware and software brings us one step closer to a seamless virtual experience!

Celebrating its 100th anniversary, Takara Tomy has announced the release of nine commemorative products, including the retro 'Rika-chan' doll and a tin car replica in the 'Tomica' series. These limited edition items will be available starting in April, allowing fans to reminisce about the iconic toys that have brought joy to generations.

And finally, in a lighter news story, the iconic 'laughing man' logo from the popular anime series 'Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex' is now being distributed for free. Fans of the series can use this logo however they like, embracing the spirit of creativity and freedom.
