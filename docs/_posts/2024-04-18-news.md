Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on April 18th, 2024. In today's news, the Nintendo Switch version of the popular game 'Exit 8' was released suddenly on April 17th, surprising fans. The game has garnered a lot of attention and excitement among gamers. In another story, Pixiv, the operator of the illustration sharing site 'pixiv', has developed a high-functioning and free painting software called 'Pastela' for iPad users. This software allows users to directly post their artwork to Pixiv and offers various painting features, all for free. Additionally, Pixiv provides a paid plan that allows users to expand their cloud storage. Moving on, the Ota Ward in Tokyo has demanded a compensation of 4.8 million yen from NEC due to a system failure that occurred in October 2023. The ward announced that inadequate information sharing from NEC, who was responsible for the operation and maintenance of the system, was the cause of the incident. Next, JR Tokai announced that it will introduce fully private compartment seats with dedicated Wi-Fi on certain N700S trains on the Tokaido Shinkansen line starting from the fiscal year 2026. This new feature aims to provide passengers with a more comfortable and private travel experience. Shifting gears to the telecommunications industry, KDDI, SoftBank, and Rakuten Mobile have jointly expressed 'strong concerns' over the revised NTT law that was passed in the parliament. Their concerns mainly revolve around the 'supplementary provisions' rather than the law itself. In an unexpected move, Rakuten has released a free household budgeting app called 'Rakuten Kakeibo' on April 17th. This app allows users to manage their finances by linking their credit cards, bank accounts, and securities accounts, providing a centralized platform for income, assets, and expenses. Lastly, a debate has begun in the Upper House of the Japanese Parliament regarding the 'Security Clearance (SC) System' proposed under the 'Important Economic Security Information Protection and Utilization Act'. The system aims to restrict access to classified economic security information to qualified individuals from both public and private sectors. Some critics have compared this proposed system to a 'gift' for the U.S. President, while the Prime Minister has denied such claims. That's all for today's news from TotemoTech.
