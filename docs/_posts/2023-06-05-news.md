### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on June 5th, 2023. The movie 'Rohan Kishibe Goes to the Louvre' based on the manga and drama series is doing well, but some fans are feeling a sense of discomfort. Vlog cameras are becoming more popular, with Canon entering the market and Sony leading the way. Nikon has released a new high-performance camera called the 'Z 8'. Takara Tomy Arts will release a toy called 'THE! Gacha Handle' in October, modeled after the handle of their capsule toy vending machines. Pixela has developed a translation device using OpenAI's ChatGPT and is also working on a translation app for Android. However, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has announced a leak of personal information of COVID-19 patients due to an unauthorized viewing of the 'HER-SYS' system by a dispatched employee. Finally, Nintendo has released new pastel-colored Joy-Con controllers for the Switch, and the Agency for Cultural Affairs will hold a seminar on 'AI and Copyright' with free admission via YouTube live stream.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
