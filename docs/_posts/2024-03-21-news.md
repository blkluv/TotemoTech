Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on March 21st, 2024. In today's news, Israeli researchers have announced a side-channel attack that can steal text generated by an AI chatbot. The attack, with a success rate of over 50%, targets the text answers generated by a large language model (LLM) utilized by the AI chatbot. The researchers propose a method to recover the text responses by analyzing the AI's behavior. This raises concerns about the security of AI-generated content and the potential for unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Moving on to our next story, researchers from Kokushikan University have developed a technique to analyze the emotions conveyed by pianists during performances. By analyzing the facial expressions of pianists while they play, the researchers aim to understand the emotions the performers intend to express through their music. This method could provide valuable insights into the emotional aspects of musical performances and help composers better communicate their desired emotions to the audience.

In other news, the passing of Akira Toriyama, the creator of Dragon Ball, has elicited a wave of sadness from China. The news of Toriyama's death was widely reported by numerous Chinese media outlets. The spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Mao Ning, expressed condolences and highlighted the popularity of Toriyama's work in China, with many Chinese netizens mourning his loss. The fact that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs commented on the death of a manga artist surprised many in China and further amplified the news through authoritative media channels.

Next, let's talk about a topic that has been circulating on social media. There have been claims that bug bombs, such as 'Barsan,' are ineffective against bed bugs. To verify the accuracy of these claims, inquiries were made to the manufacturer. The manufacturer clarified that while bug bombs can cause bed bugs to retreat, they are not always effective in completely eliminating the infestation. This highlights the importance of using multiple methods for effective pest control.

Shifting gears to the legislative front, the 'Security Clearance Bill' has entered the deliberation phase in Japan's House of Representatives. The bill aims to establish the 'Security Clearance' system, which restricts access to confidential information related to economic security to qualified individuals in both the public and private sectors. The focus of the deliberations is to ensure that the regulations are not arbitrary and prevent any potential disadvantages.

In the world of digital payments, PayPay, a popular cashless payment service, has reached a milestone with over 15 million users of its 'Point Investment' feature. This feature allows users to experience simulated investment using their accumulated PayPay points. The average increase in points through this feature is an impressive 42.7%, providing users with an opportunity to make their points work for them.

Lastly, let's discuss the impact of AI on job hunting. According to surveys conducted among companies hiring new graduates, there is a challenge in assessing the individuality and skill levels of students based solely on resumes and entry sheets. In response to this, digital portfolios, including presentation slides and self-promotion videos, are now being accepted more favorably. However, there is a concern that AI-generated content may start infiltrating the job hunting process, raising questions about the extent to which AI-generated self-promotion is acceptable.
