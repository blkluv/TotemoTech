Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on December 4th, 2023. In our first news story, researchers from Tokai University have proposed a method to attack QR codes by using an invisible laser from up to 100 meters away. By shining the laser, they can change the QR code into a fake one, potentially leading users to malicious websites when scanned. This raises concerns about the security of QR codes and the potential risks users may face.

Moving on to our next story, researchers from Gifu University have developed a device that allows people to experience being a cormorant in a cormorant fishing activity called 'ukai.' The device provides an immersive experience where users can simulate swallowing ayu fish just like a cormorant. This innovative technology offers a unique way for people to understand and appreciate traditional cultural practices.

In other news, director Takeshi Kitano's latest film, 'Kubi' (Neck), has been generating attention for its captivating comedy sketches. While some viewers have been fascinated by the eccentric characters and sharp violence depicted in the film, others have found it to be more human and realistic rather than purely insane.

Moving on to the world of gaming, a real-life event for the popular smartphone game 'Pokémon GO' is currently taking place in Asakusa, Tokyo. Participants can follow an official route within the game and enjoy various attractions and sights in Asakusa while playing the game. The event has brought excitement to both Pokémon GO players and tourists visiting the area.

In virtual reality gaming news, Valve has released the 'Steam Link' app for Meta's Quest series of head-mounted displays (HMDs). This app allows users to easily play SteamVR games on Meta's Quest HMDs without the need for additional software. It offers a more convenient and accessible way to enjoy virtual reality gaming.

Shifting gears to the banking industry, the All Bank Network experienced a network outage recently, and the cause was identified as a 'design oversight.' The All Bank Network Association and NTT Data have announced measures to prevent future outages. This incident highlights the importance of thorough design checks and the potential consequences of overlooking critical details.
