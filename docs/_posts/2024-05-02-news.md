Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on May 2nd, 2024. In recent times, there has been a lot of discussion about the impact of AI, including ChatGPT, on various jobs. One particular area of concern is the field of video editing. With the emergence of AI-powered tools, there is a fear that the demand for human video editors might decrease. However, it is still too early to determine the exact impact of AI on this profession.

Moving on to our next story, Glico, a well-known food company, has announced an extension of the suspension of shipments for their chilled food products. This suspension is due to a system failure that has affected their shipping operations. The company has not provided a definite timeline for when the shipments will resume, leaving it uncertain for now.

Now, let's talk about Square Enix. The gaming company recently announced a significant loss of approximately 22.1 billion yen. This has caused quite a stir among game fans. The loss is believed to be a result of the company's heavy reliance on specific intellectual properties (IPs). The impact of this decision and the company's future plans remain to be seen.

Moving on to retail news, Bic Camera, a popular electronics retailer, has introduced a system at all of its stores' cash registers to prevent improper tax-free sales, such as those intended for resale purposes. This system aims to curb the practice of tax-free sales being used for profit through reselling.

Next, let's discuss some resources that might interest you during the Golden Week holiday. Several companies have made their training materials available for free. These materials cover a wide range of topics, including AI utilization, behind-the-scenes of popular games like Granblue Fantasy, and even the risks associated with human waste.

Lastly, Beats, a well-known audio brand, has made two announcements. They have unveiled the 'Beats Solo Buds,' which are touted as the smallest fully wireless earphones in the history of the Beats brand. These earphones will be available for purchase in June at a price of 12,800 yen. Additionally, Beats has also introduced the 'Beats Solo 4,' a wireless headphone model featuring their proprietary chip.
