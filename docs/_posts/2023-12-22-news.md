### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on December 22nd, 2023. In today's news, we have two significant stories to discuss. The first story is about Sony's new software switcher, the 'M2L-X,' which was showcased at Inter BEE 2023. Sony, a company with a wide range of broadcasting equipment, has seen increasing interest in software switchers as part of the IP and cloud utilization trend in the professional world. We spoke to the project manager to learn more about this new product.

Moving on to our second story, we have Hitachi's global organizational restructuring. At AWS re:Invent, we had the opportunity to speak with the incoming president of the newly reorganized company. We discussed how this restructuring has changed the dynamics and relationships with major cloud vendors and competitors. Stay tuned for more details.

In other news, with the arrival of the illumination season, we explore a different way to capture stunning photos of illuminations. It's a fascinating world of creativity and innovation for both enthusiasts and casual photographers.

Next, we have an update on X, formerly known as Twitter. Users have been experiencing issues since yesterday, with posts not being displayed and timelines not updating. The problem seems to be ongoing, and we hope for a swift resolution.

Shifting gears, let's talk about ride-sharing in Japan. While ride-sharing services using private vehicles gained explosive popularity overseas, the situation in Japan has been quite different. We remember the strong opposition from taxi companies, which ultimately limited Uber's expansion to a ride-hailing service and Uber Eats. Today, we reflect on the unique circumstances that have shaped the ride-sharing landscape in Japan.

In a recent survey conducted by Bandai on children's Christmas wishes, electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, and PCs made their debut in the top five desired gifts for 2023. This marks the first time non-toy electronic devices have made it into the top five since the survey began in 1995. The increased use of tablets in elementary schools is believed to have influenced this shift.

Lastly, Rakuten Pay now supports smartphone app payments for national taxes. Users can conveniently use Rakuten Points and Rakuten Cash for their tax payments. This integration provides a seamless cashless payment experience for users of Rakuten Pay.

That's all for today's news. Thank you for tuning in to TotemoTech. Stay updated with the latest tech news, and we'll be back with more stories soon.   Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
