### Transcript

Hello and welcome to TotemoTech on April 28, 2023. Let's take a look at some of today's news stories.

First up, we have a fun music game that allows users to create "cool music" with just a few clicks. The web app allows for mixing with music materials from well-known musicians around the world. It's a great little break from the day and worth checking out.

Moving on to air conditioning trends for the summer, manufacturers are focusing on energy-saving features due to rising costs. Many new models are incorporating sensors and AI to balance comfort and energy efficiency. Some companies are even releasing battery-operated models for portability.

Next, we have an interesting story about a new wristwatch from Casio that has been generating buzz online. Dubbed the "Cheap Casio," the LF-20W is set to release in May. Casio was asked about the branding, and we'll have to wait and see what they have to say.

In other news, a recent report by CODA estimates that piracy of Japanese content, including manga and anime, has caused damages of up to 2 trillion yen globally in 2022, with the number increasing fivefold during the pandemic.

Nikon has also announced an upcoming online launch event, teasing a new product release. We'll have to wait until May 10th to find out what they have in store.

KDDI is offering a promotion code for its online-only plan, povo 2.0, which includes 300MB of data usage for three days.

Finally, PayPay's "Point Investment" service, provided by its subsidiary PPSC Investment Service, has reached 10 million users in just three years since its launch.

Unfortunately, we also have news of a 27-hour outage at Google Cloud's Paris region due to water damage in the data center. The company has stated that there is currently no timeline for full recovery.

That's it for today's news. Check back tomorrow for more updates. And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
