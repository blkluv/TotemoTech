### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on May 11th, 2023. Google has announced the release of a new tablet, the Google Pixel Tablet, with a starting price of 7,9800 yen. The tablet comes in two models, 128GB and 256GB. Additionally, Gmail will soon have a new feature, 'Help me write,' which uses AI to generate email responses based on the content of the email. In China, a court has made the country's first ruling regarding the intellectual property rights of virtual humans created using AI. However, there are still unresolved issues with the ruling. Researchers at Tokyo Institute of Technology have investigated the prevalence of 'dark patterns,' malicious user interface designs meant to deceive users, in popular mobile apps in Japan. Meanwhile, researchers in France have proposed a contact lens that can project images onto objects the wearer is looking at using an infrared laser pointer. Finally, the G7 Education Ministers' Meeting in Japan will include a declaration acknowledging the positive and negative impacts of digital technologies, including AI, on education.
