Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on April 24th, 2024. In today's news, we have two significant stories to discuss.

First, HOYA, a Japanese company, has announced that their systems, which were affected by a cyberattack, are gradually returning to normal. On the 23rd, HOYA reported that most of their systems have been restored and that their production and supply activities are generally back on track.

Moving on to our second story, there is an ongoing issue with the suspension of adult content payments by overseas credit card brands. Many companies, including Axis, have revealed that they are unable to resume these payments for the foreseeable future. Some companies have even decided to abandon the continuation of their services.

In other news, the Japanese government is considering the full legalization of ride-sharing services, such as Uber and Lyft, on weekends nationwide. Prime Minister Kishida has stated that the government plans to gradually lift restrictions on ride-sharing in areas where taxis are in short supply, starting this month.

Adobe has released the beta version (version 25.6) of their popular photo editing tool, Photoshop. The new version features a refreshed AI model called 'Adobe Firefly Image 3 Foundation,' which improves the quality of generated images. It also includes new functions such as the ability to load reference images.

For those who are fans of the adorable character 'Chiikawa,' there's exciting news. The 'Chiikawa Desktop Light' is now available for purchase at Village Vanguard Online Store. This light not only serves as a desk lamp but also supports wireless charging for smartphones.

On the topic of fonts, April 10th was Font Day, and several new fonts were announced. One of the highlights this year is the introduction of 'Japanese Variable Fonts.' These fonts allow for dynamic changes in appearance based on different factors.

Lastly, DNP (Dai Nippon Printing) has released a new system called the 'DNP Dialogue Support System.' This system converts real-time speech into text and displays it on transparent screens, emphasizing important words. One unique feature is the ability to automatically select the optimal font based on the emotions expressed in the words.

That concludes today's news from TotemoTech. Thank you for listening!   Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
