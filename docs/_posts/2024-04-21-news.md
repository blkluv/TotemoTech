### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on April 21st, 2024. In today's news, the latest installment of the 'Detective Conan' movie series, titled 'Detective Conan: The Five Stars of a Million Dollars,' has been released in theaters since April 12th. However, there has been some discussion on social media about the animation quality in the second half of the movie. Some viewers have expressed disappointment with the animation. Moving on to our next story, the Shikoku Regional Development Bureau of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism has posted a photo on X (formerly known as Twitter) featuring a sign that reads 'Creating Minecraft World Data.' The photo depicts a surveying landscape, which has sparked conversations online, with some comparing it to a photoshopped image. The bureau has actually recreated a part of the 'National Sanuki Mannou Park' in Minecraft and made the world data available for free. The photo was shared to showcase the surveying process for expanding the area. Now, let's move on to our next news item. The web browser version of X has recently replaced the 'Trends' section with a new section called 'Explore.' By clicking on 'Show more,' users can access the traditional trend display page. This sudden change has left some users confused and wondering about the reason behind the switch. Next up, confectionery company Ezaki Glico has announced a temporary halt in the shipment of chilled food products, including dairy products, Western-style sweets, fruit juices, and soft drinks. This decision was made due to a system malfunction. Products such as 'Cafe au Lait' and 'Pucchin Pudding' are among the items affected by the shipment suspension. Moving on, Universal Studios Japan (USJ) has announced a delay in the opening of the 'Donkey Kong' area. Originally scheduled for spring 2024, the opening has been postponed to the latter half of the year. The delay is aimed at enhancing the overall quality and experience of the attraction. In other news, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has revealed plans to project a 'Godzilla: Attack on Tokyo' projection mapping show on the exterior wall of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building in Shinjuku starting from the 27th of this month. The projection will feature a life-sized Godzilla, creating a thrilling experience for visitors. And finally, NTT Docomo will begin selling a touch payment-enabled smart ring called 'EVERING' in early May. The ring supports Visa touch payment and comes in two options: a standard plan for one-time purchase and a monthly subscription plan priced at 550 yen. Even users without a Docomo mobile contract can utilize the smart ring. That's all for today's news. Thank you for listening to TotemoTech. Stay tuned for more tech updates in our next episode.
