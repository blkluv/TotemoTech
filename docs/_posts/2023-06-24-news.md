Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on June 24th, 2023. In today's news, the anime 'NieR:Automata' will finally air its remaining 4 episodes in July. The TV anime, which had been delayed, will be broadcasted all at once. Fans of the game and anime can look forward to the conclusion of the series.

In other news, movie ticket prices have become more expensive, with 50% of major movie theaters raising their prices. The increase is attributed to rising utility costs and investments in cashless payment terminals. It seems that going to the movies will be a bit more costly from now on.

Moving on, a unique invention called the 'sushi fader' is gaining attention on social media. This device, which looks like a sushi roll, is designed for adjusting audio levels in sound systems. People are even having fun with it by participating in a pun-filled contest. The development of the 'sushi fader' was inspired by the desire to create a fun and functional tool for sound engineers.

Next, let's talk about the viral sensation of the 'Sakabanbaspis,' an ancient fish species. The model of this prehistoric fish has become popular online, with some users even creating illustrations and using them for commercial purposes. However, there have been concerns raised about potential copyright infringement. To shed light on the matter, a lawyer was consulted for their opinion on the legality of illustrating the model of the 'Sakabanbaspis.'

In gaming news, Bandai has launched a new feature called 'WEB Instruction Manuals' for over 1,000 Gundam plastic model kits. This online platform allows users to search and view instruction manuals for a wide range of Gundam models. It's a convenient resource for Gundam enthusiasts and collectors.

Shifting gears, NovelAI, an image generation AI service, has expressed concerns about leaked models and the unauthorized use of their AI technology. The company has stated that they may take legal action if they come across leaked models. This serves as a reminder for the importance of respecting intellectual property rights.

In software news, Blackmagic Design has released the public beta version of DaVinci Resolve 18.5, a popular editing tool. One of the new features is an AI-powered transcription function that supports Japanese. To test its accuracy, the functionality was put to the test, and the results were examined.

Lastly, Stack Overflow conducted a survey among approximately 90,000 IT engineers to determine the most commonly used programming languages, cloud services, frameworks, and databases. The top-ranking language and technologies were revealed, providing insights into the preferences of IT professionals.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
