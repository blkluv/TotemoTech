### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on January 30th, 2024. In our first news story, researchers from Harvard University and other institutions have published a study on the effects of multivitamin/mineral (MVM) supplements on the cognitive function of older adults. The study found that regular intake of MVM supplements can help reduce memory decline in middle-aged and older individuals. This research sheds light on potential strategies for maintaining cognitive health as we age.

Moving on to our next story, a group of researchers from Wuhan University in China and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore have developed a technique to detect and locate hidden wireless cameras in a room using a smartphone. The method has a detection accuracy of over 95% and can be completed in less than 30 seconds. This innovation has implications for privacy and security, as it allows individuals to protect themselves from unauthorized surveillance.

Next, we turn to a story about TOPPAN's internal communication reform. TOPPAN, a company in Japan, implemented unique measures to enhance workplace communication, including the use of a vending machine that provides conversation starters and the introduction of pet robots. These initiatives aimed to increase casual conversations and foster a more engaging work environment.

In other news, Uber Japan has announced its plans to collaborate with taxi companies to introduce a ride-sharing service in Japan, starting in April 2024. This localized version of ride-sharing aims to provide convenient transportation options and enhance mobility for individuals across the country.

Moving on, a validation study using the ZOZOSUIT and a smartphone app has been conducted to evaluate the extent of swelling (lymphedema) in cancer patients after surgery. By measuring the circumference of the limbs using the ZOZOSUIT and the app, healthcare professionals can assess the severity of secondary lymphedema and tailor treatment plans accordingly.

Shifting gears, Rakuten Mobile, a telecommunications company in Japan, has announced that it will start charging a contract termination fee for users who cancel their subscription within one year, even if they had no intention of using the service. The company claims that this fee is justified based on objective and rational criteria, but it has faced criticism for potentially penalizing customers who changed their minds or were unaware of the fee.

Lastly, we explore the expansion of Amazon Web Services (AWS) into the broadcasting industry in Japan. While AWS is primarily known for its cloud services, it has been making inroads into the Japanese broadcasting sector. By leveraging AI capabilities and streamlining operational processes, AWS aims to enhance efficiency and empower broadcasters with advanced technological solutions.
