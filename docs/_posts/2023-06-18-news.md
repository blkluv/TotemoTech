Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on June 18th, 2023. In today's news, we have two significant stories to discuss.

First, a security breach has been discovered in Parpass' energy management system for energy providers. It was revealed that an attacker had repeatedly logged in using multiple sets of legitimate IDs and passwords. Parpass, a company involved in housing equipment and IT services, is now investigating the incident and the extent of the damage caused by the malware.

Moving on to our second story, Toyota has unveiled its latest concept car, the GR H2 Racing Concept. This car is equipped with a hydrogen engine and hybrid powertrain, with the aim of participating in the prestigious Le Mans 24-hour race in the future. Toyota's focus on hydrogen technology highlights their commitment to sustainable and eco-friendly transportation.

In other news, Sakura Internet has announced its plan to launch a cloud service specifically designed for AI applications. With a government subsidy of 6.8 billion yen, Sakura Internet aims to establish a large-scale cloud infrastructure equipped with over 2,000 NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs. This initiative will support the growing demand for AI development and research.

NTT Data, a leading IT services provider, is set to launch a data integration platform called D-Resilio. This platform aims to aggregate and visualize disaster-related information, reducing the burden on local governments and businesses during times of crisis. By facilitating efficient information sharing and early response planning, NTT Data aims to contribute to minimizing the impact of disasters.

Mercedes-Benz has announced the integration of the AI-powered voice assistant, ChatGPT, in over 900,000 vehicles sold in the United States. Leveraging Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service, this integration aims to enhance the driving experience by providing natural language interaction and personalized assistance.

Microsoft, on the other hand, has outlined its strategy to incorporate AI technology across all its products. During a keynote speech at the Interop Tokyo 2023 exhibition, Microsoft's executive emphasized the company's commitment to integrating AI capabilities into various domains, including their flagship products.

In Japan, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is considering revising the regulations on smartphone sales. The ministry aims to address the issue of selling smartphones for as low as 1 yen by either tightening or relaxing the existing regulations. A panel of experts has been formed to evaluate the effectiveness and challenges of the current regulations, including the complete separation of communication fees and device costs.

Lastly, let's solve a quiz! Can you guess the identity of a young entrepreneur who is deeply involved in the buzzworthy fields of AI, nuclear fusion power, and quantum computing? This individual, in their 30s, has made significant contributions to these cutting-edge technologies and is gaining recognition in the tech industry.   And that's all for today's news.
