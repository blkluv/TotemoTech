### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 31st, 2023. In today's news, we have some exciting developments in the world of artificial intelligence.

First up, Meta, the company behind Facebook, has introduced a new language model called Llama 2. Llama 2 is being hailed as a competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT, and it is expected to give it a run for its money. What sets Llama 2 apart is that it can be run on a local PC, making it accessible to users without the need for powerful cloud servers. The team at Meta has provided a Text Generation web UI to test Llama 2, and early results are promising.

Moving on to our next story, researchers at The Simulation, a visual production company, have developed an AI showrunner that can automatically generate episodes of a TV show based on text prompts. This AI showrunner has the ability to turn the daily lives of an AI-populated town into a television program. It's an innovative approach to content creation and could revolutionize the entertainment industry.

In other news, Google has released a large-scale training dataset for natural language-based control of Android devices. Researchers from Google Research and Google DeepMind have proposed this dataset, which aims to enable users to interact with their Android devices using natural language commands. This development could lead to more intuitive and user-friendly interactions with our smartphones and tablets.

Next, we have an interesting experiment involving a portable cooler. With the summer heat in full swing, staying cool indoors is a priority. Portable coolers offer a convenient solution for rooms without air conditioning or during AC breakdowns. A recent test was conducted to evaluate the cooling capabilities of a portable cooler priced at 40,000 yen. The results showed that it is a practical and effective alternative in situations where traditional cooling options are not available.

Moving on, the long-awaited Sumidagawa Fireworks Festival is set to make a comeback after a four-year hiatus. The festival, famous for its stunning fireworks display, will also be available for online streaming, allowing viewers to enjoy the spectacle from the comfort of their homes.

In the world of gaming, the highly anticipated release of Pikmin 4 has delighted fans and even caught the attention of manga artists. The game's accessibility and the adorable character, Olimar, have garnered praise from players and critics alike. Pikmin 4 promises to deliver an enjoyable and heartwarming gaming experience.

Lastly, we explore the fascinating combination of AI and poetry. An experiment was conducted to transform haiku poems into movies using a generative AI service. The phrase 'The sound of a frog jumping into water' was given as a prompt, and the AI produced a surprising result—a charming children's song. This demonstrates the creative potential of AI in transforming written works into visual and auditory experiences.

That's all for today's news. Stay tuned for more exciting updates from the world of technology and innovation. Thank you for listening!   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
