Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on December 3rd, 2023. In our top stories today, NTT Data has disclosed the cause of the recent nationwide banking system failure, while the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has put forward a proposal to abolish the NTT Law by 2025.

During a press conference held on December 1st, NTT Data and the Nationwide Banking Network (全銀ネット) revealed that the system failure was due to insufficient memory allocation caused by a table size expansion oversight during an operating system update. NTT Data's Vice President, Masanori Suzuki, stated that there were no issues with the physical system resources, but the program did not have enough memory allocated. The incident prompted discussions on the need for better system maintenance and updates.

In a separate development, the LDP convened a project team meeting on December 1st to discuss the future of the NTT Law. The party conditionally approved a proposal to abolish the law by 2025, contingent on the implementation of measures to ensure fair competition and foreign investment regulations. The discussions focused on creating a level playing field and fostering innovation in the telecommunications sector.

Moving on to other news, Tokyo Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance announced a potential information leak in their auto liability insurance system, 'e-JIBAI.' It was discovered that unauthorized access to customer information was possible for agents from 120 affiliated stores. The insurance company promptly addressed the issue and emphasized its commitment to protecting customer data.

Meanwhile, Hiroshima University Hospital experienced a system failure that affected the accessibility of electronic medical records (EMRs) on December 1st. As a result, the hospital suspended all medical services for the day. The hospital's staff worked diligently to resolve the issue, with specialized departments collaborating to minimize the impact on patient care. External prescriptions were still available to ensure continuity of medication.
