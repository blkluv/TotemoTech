In other news, GMO Brand Security has introduced a virtual idol group called Trademark Boys45, or TMB45 for short. The group consists of virtual idols representing all 45 categories of trademark classification.

Moving on, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department's Life Safety Special Investigation Unit has conducted a search of the premises related to a male YouTuber known as 'Rengoku Coroaki,' who is suspected of damaging the reputation of a woman through his posted videos. The police searched the locations on suspicion of defamation. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has also interviewed the male YouTuber voluntarily to gather information.

Next, let's delve into the recent conflict between NTT (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone) and three major telecommunications companies regarding the proposed revision of the 'NTT Law.' NTT argues that the role of the NTT Law has been fulfilled through obligations such as research and development disclosure and a review of universal services. However, competitors such as KDDI and SoftBank insist that as long as NTT possesses 'special assets,' the NTT Law should be maintained. The discussions between NTT and its competitors have reached a deadlock. We will explore the reasons behind the sudden revision of the NTT Law and the intense opposition between NTT and its competitors.

Shifting gears, the idol unit 'StuPuri' has been selected to participate in the prestigious 'Kohaku Uta Gassen' music program, marking their first appearance in the annual New Year's Eve event. StuPuri is a unique idol group where all the members are represented as illustrated characters and have gained popularity through their activities on video-sharing sites and social media.

Lastly, the Japan Information Economy Society Promotion Association (JIPDEC), the organization responsible for the 'Privacy Mark Certification System,' has revealed a case of information leakage. It was discovered that evaluation committee documents related to the Privacy Mark, which assesses and certifies the handling of personal information, had been leaked for approximately three years. The leak occurred due to the committee members storing the documents on their personal computers, making them visible to external parties.
