### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on December 23rd, 2023. In today's news, we have some interesting stories to share. First up, the 'Wearable Heating' device by Sanco has been making waves in the market, generating a staggering 600 million yen in sales. With the sudden drop in temperature, the choice of heating appliances has become a pressing issue due to soaring energy costs. Unlike traditional heating devices like air conditioners, the 'Wearable Heating' focuses on warming the person wearing it, making it highly energy-efficient. We spoke to the product manager at Sanco to learn more about the new features of this season's products.

Moving on to our next story, OrioSpec, based in Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo, has introduced a unique gaming PC called the 'CoolerMaster Sneaker X Gaming PC Desktop.' Priced at 473,000 yen for the standard model, this gaming PC features a sneaker-shaped case, adding a touch of style to the gaming experience.

In other news, the Japanese government has officially decided to abolish the current paper health insurance cards and consolidate them into a single digital card called the 'My Number Insurance Card' by December 2nd, 2024. This move aims to streamline the healthcare system and improve efficiency.

On the entertainment front, the anime series 'Zon100: 100 Things I Want to Do Before Becoming a Zombie' will be resuming after a hiatus. The remaining three episodes will be broadcast consecutively on December 25th, with a compilation of episodes 1 to 7 available on YouTube. Fans of the series can look forward to catching up on the exciting zombie-filled adventures.

Shifting gears to technology news, there's a sense of urgency in smartphone shops as they urge customers to make their purchases before December 26th. This is due to new discount regulations that will come into effect on the 27th. The exact details of these regulations are still unclear, but it seems that the changes may affect the pricing and discounts offered on smartphones. If you're planning to buy a new smartphone, it might be worth considering the timing of your purchase.

In a surprising turn of events, the popular online media outlet 'Daily Portal Z' has recently become an independent company. The platform, previously under the umbrella of the Tokyu Group, has been transferred to a new company owned by editor-in-chief Yushi Hayashi. Despite the projected financial challenges, we had the opportunity to speak candidly with Mr. Hayashi about his concerns and hopes for the future of the platform.

Lastly, we have a cautionary tale for web application developers. The upload function in web applications can sometimes hide potential risks. As online businesses become more prevalent, incidents involving vulnerabilities can have severe consequences. In this series, we explore the story of the web application 'BadTodo,' used for vulnerability testing, and delve into the pitfalls that developers should be aware of when creating web applications.
