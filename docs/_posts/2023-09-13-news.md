Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on September 13th, 2023. In today's news, Apple has announced some exciting developments with its new iPhone 15 Pro. The device will feature a new function called 'Spatial Video,' which is reminiscent of a trend from 12 years ago. We'll hear from a journalist who has been closely following smartphone cameras to explain more.

In other Apple news, the company has started selling a Lightning to USB-C adapter in Japan. Priced at 4,780 yen, this adapter is designed for Lightning accessories. This move comes as Apple continues to make changes to its product lineup.

Moving on to pricing details, Apple Japan has revealed the prices for the iPhone 15 series. The base model, iPhone 15 with 128GB storage, starts at 124,800 yen. Compared to the previous iPhone 14 series, this represents a maximum price increase of 10,000 yen.

On the Pro side, Apple has also announced the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. These devices come with USB-C support, the new A17 Pro chip, and the Pro series' first-ever titanium body. The Pro Max variant even boasts a '5x zoom' feature.

Continuing with Apple's announcements, the company has unveiled the iPhone 15, which marks the first time in 11 years that Apple has refreshed the connector by adopting USB-C. This change is expected to bring new possibilities and convenience to iPhone users.

Shifting gears to wearables, Apple has introduced the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. These new smartwatches come with various enhancements, including the ability to operate the screen without touching it, allowing users to control the devices with their fingers.

Lastly, in entertainment news, the popular anime 'Attack on Titan' is coming to an end after 10 years of broadcasting. To celebrate this milestone, the publisher Kodansha has announced an online event where fans can participate and enjoy a virtual 'afterparty,' although there is an admission fee.

That concludes today's news from TotemoTech. Stay tuned for more updates and insights on the latest tech trends.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
