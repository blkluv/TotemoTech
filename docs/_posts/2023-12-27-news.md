Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on December 27th, 2023. In today's news, Panasonic's latest camera, the 'LUMIX G100D,' is gaining attention for its excellent video capabilities and its versatility as a snap camera. The G100D is a digital interchangeable lens camera that caters to both beginners and vloggers, making it a compelling choice for everyday photography as well. Moving on to our next story, Fujitsu has announced the establishment of a new company called 'F-SUSTECH' to handle its hardware business. The company will focus on servers, storage, network products, and corporate PCs, taking over these operations from Fujitsu. This strategic move allows Fujitsu to streamline its hardware business while enabling F-SUSTECH to concentrate on delivering innovative solutions to its customers. Now, let's turn our attention to the world of gaming PCs. Third Wave has unveiled a 3D simulator called the 'GALLERIA CUSTOMIZE SIMULATOR,' which allows users to recreate and customize their own GALLERIA gaming PCs. This simulator provides a new way for consumers to choose their ideal PC setup and will be available at select DOSPARA stores starting January 26th, 2024. Moving on, the Financial Services Agency and the National Police Agency have jointly issued a warning about a surge in phishing attacks leading to unauthorized fund transfers. These attacks involve the theft of net banking IDs and passwords, resulting in fraudulent money transfers. They urge the public to remain vigilant and take necessary precautions to protect their personal information. Shifting gears, the Matsuo Lab at the University of Tokyo is seeking researchers and development engineers to join their team and contribute to the advancement of large-scale language models (LLMs). The lab aims to accelerate LLM research in 2024 by expanding its team. And finally, Rakuten has announced a change in its shareholder benefits program. Instead of distributing electronic money, Rakuten Cash, as it did until 2022, the company will now provide shareholders with free data-only eSIMs for Rakuten Mobile, offering 30GB of data per month. This new benefit reflects Rakuten's focus on its mobile services and its commitment to enhancing the shareholder experience. That's all for today's news.
