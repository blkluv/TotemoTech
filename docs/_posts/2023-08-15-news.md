Moving on, a recent survey conducted by Job Soken, a research and consulting firm specializing in careers and work styles, revealed that more than 60% of respondents prefer teleworking as their ideal way of working during the summer.

Shifting gears to the entertainment industry, the movie 'Barbie' has made a strong start in Japan, earning 190 million yen in just three days of release. However, the film faced controversy before its release due to promotional activities.
