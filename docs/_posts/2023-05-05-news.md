Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on May 5th. 

Twitter has announced that it will allow government and public service agencies to use its API for free to provide up-to-date information on weather alerts, transportation updates, emergency notifications, and more. This move is aimed at helping these agencies disseminate important information to the public more efficiently. 

Amazon's Ring series of smart home security devices has added a new product to its lineup, the Ring Spotlight Cam Plus. This camera comes with a built-in light and is designed to enhance the security of homes by providing a clear view of the surrounding area. 

Google has announced that it will be adding support for PassKey in Google accounts, which will allow users to sign in without a password. This feature is being rolled out gradually, and users will soon be able to enable PassKey when signing in to their Google Workspace accounts. Google sees this as a step towards a password-free future. 

iPhone users can now edit their photos to create stunning images with just a few taps. Apple has improved its standard photo editing tools to provide users with more control over their images, allowing them to adjust brightness, color, and other settings to bring out the best in their photos. 

The National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo is showcasing the history of mammalogy in Japan with an exhibit called "The Trajectory of Mammalogy in Japan." The exhibit features specimens from the museum's collection and highlights the contributions of Japanese scientists to the field of mammalogy. 

Apple and Google have teamed up to develop a new industry standard for preventing the unauthorized use of location tracking devices. The companies will work together to create a system that will alert users if their device is being used for tracking purposes without their knowledge. Other companies that make "lost prevention tags" such as Samsung, Tile, Chipolo, eufy Security, and Pebblebee are also participating in this effort. 

[PayPay](/companies/paypay), a popular mobile payment service in Japan, is changing its requirements for participating in campaigns and promotions. Starting July 1st, users will need to make at least 30 payments of 200 yen or more to be eligible for certain rewards. Additionally, PayPay will require users to undergo identity verification in order to participate in some promotions. 

Finally, [au Jibun Bank](/companies/au-jibun-bank) has temporarily suspended instant transfers and deposits to accounts at other banks in an effort to prevent fraudulent transactions. The bank has changed the processing time for these transactions to ensure that they are properly vetted before being completed. This move is aimed at increasing security and reducing the risk of unauthorized transfers. And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
