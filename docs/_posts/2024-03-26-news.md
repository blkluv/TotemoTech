Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on March 26th, 2024. In today's news, the Japanese Record Association has reached an agreement with 11 individuals involved in illegal music uploading. The association announced that the Tokyo District Court has ruled for Internet Service Providers to disclose the identities of users who continuously uploaded a large number of music files using the file-sharing software 'BitTorrent'. As part of the agreement, the individuals will be required to pay an average of 400,000 yen in compensation.

Moving on to our next story, the Digital Agency has announced the official adoption of the redesigned homepage for the 'My Number Portal'. The portal, which provides information related to the 'My Number' system, has incorporated feedback from users of the pilot version to finalize the design. The 'My Number Portal' aims to provide a comprehensive platform for individuals to access and manage their personal identification numbers.

In other news, NEXCO West Japan has reported the loss of a USB memory device that may have contained personal information of 191 individuals. While the data on the device was encrypted, it was discovered that the password was attached to the memory device itself. NEXCO West Japan is currently investigating the incident and taking necessary measures to ensure data security.

Next, pharmaceutical company Kobayashi Pharmaceutical temporarily made the 'Red Koji' page on its central research institute's website unavailable. According to the company, there were internal discussions regarding the 'Red Koji' products, which are currently undergoing voluntary recalls. The page's temporary unavailability is a result of these internal deliberations.

In the realm of data security, the Personal Information Protection Commission has issued guidance to MK System, the provider of the cloud service 'Sharo Yume' for labor and social security consultants, following a month-long suspension due to a ransomware attack. The commission found that the service had weak security measures, including easily guessable administrator passwords and significant vulnerabilities. MK System has been instructed to address these issues to ensure the protection of personal information.

Lastly, four companies, including Kanematsu Corporation, have announced the establishment of the 'Japan Cyber Security Fund No. 1 Investment Business Limited Liability Partnership'. This fund aims to invest in Japanese security companies and is set to launch on April 1st. With a target size of up to 10 billion yen, the fund plans to engage with security companies and financial institutions to support the growth and development of the cybersecurity industry in Japan.
