### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on February 1st, 2024. In today's news, we have some interesting stories to share. First up, Japan's Nippon TV has announced preventive measures in response to the donation scandal surrounding the 24-Hour TV program. The network will introduce new regulations and implement cashless donations to prevent a recurrence of the incident.

Moving on to our next story, QPS Institute has released high-definition images of Goryokaku and Fukuoka PayPay Dome. These images were captured by the small SAR satellite called Tsukuyomi-I in its high-resolution mode with a resolution of 46cm. The detailed images provide a clear view of these landmarks.

Next, let's talk about the MAGI system from the anime Evangelion. This AI system has come up with innovative ideas to improve the accuracy of output results in the era of generative AI. The MAGI system is being considered as a suitable method to enhance the performance of generative AI.

Now, let's discuss the topic of compatible batteries. Accidents related to compatible batteries have been on the rise. While it is true that choosing genuine batteries is the safest option, it's important to note that not all compatible batteries are fake. Some people who frequently use electric tools or cameras have a different perspective on compatible batteries. It's not a black-and-white situation, and there are circumstances where compatible batteries can be a viable choice.

In other news, WeWork Japan has filed for civil rehabilitation and SoftBank will take over its operations without making any changes to the service level or contract conditions. WeWork Japan's entire business will be transferred to a new wholly-owned subsidiary called WWJ, established by SoftBank.

Additionally, starting from today, several AM radio stations will temporarily suspend their broadcasts. This decision is being made as these stations consider transitioning to FM or internet radio. The impact on listeners and society will be carefully examined during this process.

Lastly, the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare has announced a collaboration with the anime series 'Yakusoku no Neverland' to promote the use of electronic prescriptions. The aim is to raise awareness and promote the widespread adoption of electronic prescriptions.
