### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on August 2nd, 2023. In today's news, we have two fascinating tech stories to discuss.

First up, researchers at the University of Maryland have proposed a framework to embed electronic watermarks, also known as watermarks, into text generated by large language models (LLMs). These watermarks are invisible to humans but can be detected by machines. This development could have significant implications for copyright protection and content authentication.

Moving on to our second story, a team of researchers from Tsinghua University in China has developed a non-invasive interface that can connect the human brain to a computer through a spiral-shaped brainwave measuring device. This device, which can be inserted into the ear canal, allows for direct communication between the brain and the computer. The potential applications of this technology range from brain-computer interfaces to assistive devices for individuals with disabilities.

That's all for today's news from TotemoTech. Stay tuned for more exciting tech updates in the future!   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
