### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on April 27th, 2024. Today, we have some interesting news stories to share. First up, Sharp has launched its first circulator, incorporating 'nature technology' inspired by the shape of an owl's wings. The new fan provides a powerful airflow while maintaining a quiet operation. It took Sharp over three years to develop this innovative fan, which can be easily disassembled for cleaning and features Plasmacluster NEXT technology to eliminate odors from damp laundry. We spoke to a representative from Sharp who was involved in the development process.

In other news, Evernote, owned by Bending Spoons, has reassured its Japanese customers that they can continue using the service despite the dissolution of its Japanese subsidiary. Evernote's official X (formerly Twitter) account posted a message stating that Japanese customers can still use Evernote as usual. The dissolution of Evernote Japan was announced in the official gazette on April 26th.

Moving on, Epic Games has released Reality Capture 1.4, a high-performance photogrammetry software that allows users to create 3D representations of real-world spaces using multiple images and laser scan data. The latest version of Reality Capture introduces a new pricing structure, offering free access to individuals and businesses with annual revenue below $1 million.

In an effort to enhance convenience, Seven-Eleven Japan and Sharp have expanded their test of QR code scanning microwave ovens to 1,080 Seven-Eleven stores in the Tokai region. By scanning the QR code on a product label using the microwave's camera, the oven automatically sets the appropriate wattage and heating time. Both companies plan to continue expanding the deployment of these innovative appliances.

In the world of entertainment, TV Tokyo announced that it will be streaming the legendary anime series 'Maicching Machiko Sensei' on platforms such as TVer, while preserving the originality of the show as it was during its original broadcast in the 1980s.

In theme park news, Oriental Land has revealed that the popular attraction 'Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters' at Tokyo Disneyland will be ending in October. The adjacent commercial facility, 'Planet M,' will also undergo renovations.

Lastly, Toyota unveiled two new battery electric vehicle (BEV) models at the Beijing International Motor Show. These models, targeted at Generation Z and families, were developed in collaboration with BYD and Toyota's joint venture companies. The release of these BEVs in China is scheduled within the next year.
