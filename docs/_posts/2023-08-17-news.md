### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on August 17th, 2023. In today's news, we have two significant stories to discuss.

First, the social networking services Nico Nico and Pixiv are urging users to change their passwords due to a data leak on the specialized Boys Love (BL) SNS platform, PictBLand. The leak exposed personal information, including user IDs and passwords. Given the close relationship between Nico Nico, Pixiv, and creators, it is crucial for users who reuse their IDs and passwords to make immediate changes.

Moving on to our second story, Sharp has released custom voices for their air purifiers, the Water Oven Helshio, Helshio Hot Cook, and Plasma Cluster Humidifying Air Purifier. These custom voices feature characters from the popular anime series 'Hirogaru Sky! Precure.' Now, users can enjoy a more interactive and entertaining experience with their air purifiers.

That's all for today's news from TotemoTech. Stay tuned for more updates on the latest tech developments.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
