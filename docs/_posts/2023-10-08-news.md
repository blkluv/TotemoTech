### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on October 8th, 2023. In today's news, Honda has released the new N-BOX, a compact wagon-type car with an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that features a refreshed sensor system. The previous model used a monocular camera and millimeter-wave radar for its sensors, but the new N-BOX eliminates the millimeter-wave radar and relies solely on a wide-angle camera to monitor the front of the vehicle.

In other news, Sharp has announced its entry into the local 5G market by developing a system that allows companies and local governments to build their own wireless communication environments. The system, which is expected to be shipped starting from December 2023, includes sub6 and standalone (SA) compatible base stations and terminals.

Moving on, NTT Communications and Susono City in Shizuoka Prefecture have begun a demonstration experiment using smart streetlights equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) cameras and sensors, as well as local 5G, to detect vehicles that exceed the speed limit.

In the automotive industry, the Japan Automobile Dealers Association (JADA) and the All-Japan Light Vehicle Association (AJLV) have announced the preliminary new car sales rankings for September 2023. Honda's N-BOX, a compact car, has maintained its top position for two consecutive months.

Shifting gears to the world of programming, the question of which programming language is superior, Java or Python, has been answered by ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot. ChatGPT, which has been trained on a vast amount of text, provides responses based on the general consensus. It has become a convenient tool for obtaining opinions on various topics.

In the field of system development, the emergence of AI that generates code is changing the way systems are developed. Furthermore, it is expected to impact system operations as well. With the help of generative AI, the task of identifying the causes and solutions to system troubles from extensive system logs will become more efficient.

Lastly, the US Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have announced the eradication of a botnet consisting of over 700,000 computers infected with the Qakbot malware. The authorities sent removal tools to the infected computers to neutralize the malware and retrieved over 6.4 million stolen personal information and other data.

That's all for today's news. Stay tuned for more updates from TotemoTech.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
