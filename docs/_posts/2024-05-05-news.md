Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on May 5th, 2024. In today's news, a new museum dedicated to the popular manga 'Kiniku Man' has opened in Numazu, Shizuoka Prefecture. The 'Kiniku Man Museum' is the first permanent museum for the series, and fans of all ages are excited to visit and relive their childhood memories.

Moving on to our next story, Fujifilm has introduced a unique camera called the 'instax mini 99.' This camera may seem odd as it's a fully analog 'Cheki' camera, but it allows users to apply various effects to their photos using unconventional analog techniques. Photography enthusiasts are intrigued by the possibilities this camera offers.

In other news, Rakuten Group has announced that their official character, the 'Shopping Panda,' will be getting an anime adaptation. The anime is set to air this autumn, and more details will be revealed at a later date. Rakuten has also released a promotional video on YouTube to generate excitement for the upcoming series.

Moving on to technology news, an issue has been reported with the weather app on Apple's iPhone. On May 2nd, the app displayed a false alert stating that a heavy snow warning was in effect in Bunkyo Ward, Tokyo. However, the Japan Meteorological Agency confirmed that no such warning was issued. Users were advised to check the official website for accurate information, indicating that the issue was with the iPhone app itself.

In government-related news, Dropbox and other cloud storage services have been added to the list of government-approved cloud services in Japan. The ISMAP Operating Committee, consisting of the Digital Agency and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, has registered Dropbox and other services under the government's security evaluation system for information systems. This means that these services will now be eligible for government procurement.

Switching gears, SoftBank's satellite phone service has been experiencing ongoing issues since the early hours of April 16th. As a result, the company has temporarily suspended new subscriptions for the service while they work to resolve the problem.

Finally, there has been an increase in credit card companies tightening regulations on adult content. This has raised concerns about the future of adult content and payments. In this segment, we will discuss the recent developments and provide insights into the potential impact on the industry.
