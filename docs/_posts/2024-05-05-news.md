### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on May 5th, 2024. In today's news, Ricoh has released a special edition of the GR III camera called the GR III HDF, featuring an HDF filter for improved image quality. This new model aims to provide photographers with even better results. Moving on to our next story, the second edition of the keyboard market event 'Keycket' has been announced. Following the success of the first event, which sold out all 1000 tickets, the upcoming event in spring 2025 will have double the space to accommodate more participants and showcase a wider range of custom keyboards. Now, let's shift our focus to the world of manga. The city of Numazu in Shizuoka Prefecture has opened the 'Kinnikuman Museum,' the first permanent museum dedicated to the popular manga series 'Kinnikuman.' Fans of the series, including myself, are excited to visit this long-awaited museum and immerse ourselves in the world of our childhood heroes. Turning to photography, Fujifilm has introduced a unique camera called the 'instax mini 99.' This analog camera allows users to apply various effects to their photos, resulting in distinctive and artistic images. It's a camera that embraces the charm of analog photography while offering a touch of creativity. Shifting gears to the world of animation, Rakuten Group has announced that their official character, 'Shopping Panda,' will be getting an anime adaptation. The anime is set to air this fall, and more details will be revealed at a later date. To wrap up our news, we have a tech glitch involving iPhone's weather app. On May 2nd, some users in Tokyo's Bunkyo Ward received a false alert stating that a heavy snow warning was in effect. The Japan Meteorological Agency confirmed that no such warning was issued and advised users to check their official website for accurate information. This incident appears to be a bug within the iPhone app. Lastly, Dropbox has made it onto the list of 'Government Certified Cloud Services.' The ISMAP Operating Committee, composed of the Digital Agency and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, has registered Dropbox and other cloud storage services on the government's list of certified cloud services. This means that these services will be eligible for government procurement in the future.   Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
