### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on November 22nd, 2023. Good day, tech enthusiasts! Here are today's top stories.

First up, the popular chat AI developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT, experienced a temporary outage this morning. Users reported being unable to access ChatGPT and its API, causing disruptions in their work. However, the issue was resolved around 10:30 AM JST, and our editorial team can confirm that access has been restored.

Moving on to our next story, let's revisit a significant incident that occurred a while back. In January and February of this year, KDDI, a major Japanese telecommunications company, faced a massive cloud outage. Today, we'll take a closer look at the aftermath and the steps taken by KDDI to address the situation.

Now, let's shift our focus to an exciting development in smartphone technology. Researchers from the University of California, San Diego, and Microsoft have proposed an agent system built on GPT-4V, a language model, for graphical user interface (GUI) navigation on iPhones. This system allows users to control their iPhone screens using natural language commands, opening up new possibilities for user interaction.

Next, we explore the legal rights surrounding the misuse of synthesized voices that closely resemble a person's actual voice. Researchers from NTT Social Information Institute and Keio University have published a study investigating the copyright, publicity rights, and personal information aspects related to the use of voice synthesis technology. The study aims to shed light on the potential legal rights that individuals may have in cases involving the unauthorized use of their voice.

In other news, Stability AI, a research organization, has released a research preview version of their AI model called 'Stable Video Diffusion' on GitHub. This model generates videos based on text inputs, offering a novel approach to video creation. To access the web tool for text input, interested users will need to join the waiting list.

Lastly, let's celebrate the achievements of a game company's president. The 74-year-old president of Success, Mr. Ryuto Yoshinari, recently won the Judo World Championships. To commemorate his victory, Success has announced a special sale. Congratulations to Mr. Yoshinari on his remarkable accomplishment!

That wraps up today's news. Stay tuned for more exciting updates in the world of technology. Thank you for listening!   Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
