Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on September 9th, 2023. In today's news, Panasonic has announced that they will be changing the brand name of their power line communication technology from 'HD-PLC' to 'Nessum'. This rebranding aims to enhance the company's image and align with their future business strategy.

In other news, NTT Docomo has issued a warning about a phone scam where fraudsters impersonate the Docomo Information Center. The scammers make phone calls and use automated voice guidance to deceive victims into providing money. Docomo advises the public to be cautious and not to disclose personal or financial information over the phone.

Moving on, the Digital Agency of Japan has revised its policy on the standardization of local government systems. The original plan aimed to complete the standardization by the end of March 2026. However, due to the complexity of system migration, the agency will now set individual deadlines for systems with higher difficulty levels while maintaining the overall time limit.

Next, a parody commercial collaboration between Cup Noodle and the Metal Gear Solid game series has garnered attention. The web commercial features a scene from Metal Gear Solid that has become a popular internet meme. The creator of Metal Gear Solid, Hideo Kojima, has also reacted to the commercial, further adding to its popularity.

In tech news, Sony Semiconductor Solutions has developed a module that generates power from electromagnetic noise emitted by electronic devices. This energy harvesting technology can utilize the constant electromagnetic noise generated by monitors, lighting, and other devices to power energy-efficient IoT sensors and communication devices.

Moving on, the preview version of the Paint app now includes an automatic background removal feature. This new functionality allows users to easily remove backgrounds from images, enhancing the editing capabilities of the app.

Lastly, the new 'Hide Person' feature in Slack has sparked discussions. This feature allows users to hide messages from specific members or disable notifications from them. While some view this as a useful tool for managing communication, others express concerns about its potential misuse and its impact on workplace dynamics, including issues related to harassment.

That's all for today's news from TotemoTech. Stay tuned for more updates on the latest tech developments.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
