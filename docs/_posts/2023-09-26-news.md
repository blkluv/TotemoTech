Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on September 26th, 2023. Researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara have proposed a system called 'Wiffract' that uses only Wi-Fi signals to enable high-quality imaging of stationary objects through walls. This system could have various applications, such as detecting hidden objects or monitoring indoor environments.

In another study, researchers from the University of California, San Diego and other institutions have presented a research report on email spoofing attacks. These attacks involve impersonating government agencies, major financial institutions, and media organizations using famous domain names. The researchers highlight the need for improved email security measures to prevent such attacks.

Moving on to exciting developments in artificial intelligence, OpenAI's chatbot AI, ChatGPT, has announced the implementation of image recognition, speech recognition, and speech synthesis capabilities. This enhancement will be rolled out to Plus and Enterprise users over the next two weeks, enabling more interactive and versatile conversations with the AI.

In the world of gaming and fashion, Casio Computer has unveiled two collaboration models of their popular G-SHOCK watches in partnership with Riot Games' online game 'League of Legends.' These limited edition G-SHOCK watches feature unique designs inspired by the game, appealing to both gaming enthusiasts and watch collectors.

Shifting gears to a recent domain auction, the domain 'docomokouza.jp,' previously associated with NTT Docomo's discontinued wallet service 'Docomo Kōza,' was sold for 4.02 million yen. The auction took place on September 25th through the domain registration service 'Oname Dot Com' by GMO Internet.

In the realm of miniature collectibles, Talin International, a capsule toy business, is set to re-release their 'Palm-sized Network Equipment' capsule toys starting from September 26th. These miniature network equipment figures, created in collaboration with three manufacturers, allow users to recreate a data center setup in the palm of their hands.

Lastly, the popular password management tool '1Password' has introduced support for 'Passkeys' in its iOS version. Passkeys enable passwordless authentication, providing a more convenient and secure way for users to access their accounts. The Android version of 1Password is also expected to receive Passkey support in the near future.
