Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on May 30th, 2023. ASUS Japan has announced the release of the ROG Ally, a portable gaming PC weighing approximately 608g with a 7-inch full HD screen and the latest AMD processor. Sansan has introduced new features for its business card management service, including an AI-powered tool for creating seminar invitation emails and summarizing financial reports. The model Satsuki Ai, who appears in a gravure photo book created using AI-generated images, has opened an official Twitter account. SoftBank has implemented chat AI for its approximately 20,000 employees to improve work efficiency and productivity. A web app that uses AI to assist with the strategy portion of the Minesweeper game has become popular. Kanagawa Shimbun apologized for leaking information from a reader to a third party, which was discovered after the third party posted about it on social media. Rayark, the developer of the game DEEMO, has denied rumors that it used image-generating AI to lay off a large number of its art staff.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
