Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on April 16th, 2024. In today's news, Adobe has announced that it will be adding AI video tools to its video editing software, Adobe Premiere Pro, in the second half of 2024. The new tools will allow users to extend the length of videos and remove unwanted parts, as well as support external models such as OpenAI. This update will also include the ability to add or remove objects within a video and generate videos from text and images for B-roll footage.

Moving on to our next story, Sony PCL has announced that it will be launching a rental service for virtual production starting in May. The service will provide displays, systems, and production support from specialized staff. This will make it easier for filmmakers and content creators to access the necessary equipment and expertise for virtual production.

Next, d Anime Store has started a limited-time campaign offering a 70% discount on the continuation of anime series in electronic comic form. Fans can purchase sets of volumes 4 to 13 of their favorite anime adaptations at a significantly reduced price. This campaign aims to provide fans with an affordable way to continue enjoying their favorite anime stories.

In other news, Nico Nico Douga, a popular video-sharing platform in Japan, has announced that it will be discontinuing its '@Pizza' feature at the end of May. This feature allowed users to order pizza directly from the platform while watching videos. The decision to end this feature after 16 years has surprised many users.

Moving on, KADOKAWA has announced its collaboration with KDDI's 'Hill Mirror Magazine,' a platform that turns magazine concepts into video content. This collaboration will bring content from 'The Television' magazine to the platform, featuring artists and their 'all-positive' dramas. Fans can look forward to enjoying unique video content based on popular magazine concepts.

In the world of advertising, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is facing a problem of investment ads using the identities of famous individuals without permission. More than half of the investment ads distributed through Meta's platforms this year, including those featuring entrepreneurs Yusaku Maezawa and Takafumi Horie, are suspected of impersonation. This issue highlights the challenges of regulating misleading investment advertisements on social media platforms.

Finally, let's address a recent incident on the JR Saikyo Line. On April 15th, due to a person entering the tracks at Itabashi Station, trains were delayed, and there was a problem with the timely replacement of train crew members at some stations. Unfortunately, incorrect information spread on social media, suggesting that train crew members were missing. However, JR East has denied these claims, stating that there was no factual basis for the rumors. It serves as a reminder of the importance of verifying information before spreading it online.
