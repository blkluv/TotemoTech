Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on January 21st, 2024. In today's news, a new smartphone game release has caused quite a stir among gamers and even frustrated a popular manga artist. On the other hand, Dyson's innovative heating device, known as 'Hybrid Serum Heat,' has become a huge hit, with its popularity leading to sold-out stocks.

Let's start with the smartphone game release. On the 15th of January, a game called 'Casual Fight' was suddenly released for smartphones by HUP Games, the same developers who were behind the infamous 'Final Sword,' which was once considered a terrible game. The game's unreasonable difficulty has left even a well-known manga artist who loves challenging games scratching their head.

Shifting gears to the heating device market, Dyson's 'Hybrid Serum Heat' has caught the attention of consumers amidst rising energy costs. Priced at over 60,000 yen, the device offers energy-saving features that are in high demand. However, the product has already sold out for the 2023 fiscal year, with only remaining stocks available in stores. We spoke to the project manager to learn more about the development process and the reasons behind its popularity.

In other news, Apple has started accepting reservations for their spatial computing headset, 'Apple Vision Pro,' in the United States. The headset weighs between 600g to 650g, and additional accessories such as travel cases have also been revealed.

Moving on to space exploration, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) announced that their small lunar lander, 'SLIM,' successfully landed on the moon on January 20th. Although the lander did not generate solar power as planned, the pinpoint landing was considered a significant achievement. JAXA also mentioned that communication with the lander is functioning correctly, and telemetry data is being received.

In the tech world, Apple's MR (Mixed Reality) headset, 'Apple Vision Pro,' is now available for pre-order in the United States. Despite its hefty price tag of $3499 (approximately 518,000 yen), several users from Japan are attempting to purchase the device.

Lastly, JAXA's unmanned lunar probe, 'SLIM,' is about to embark on its lunar landing mission. Many people are eagerly awaiting the live YouTube broadcast scheduled for 11:00 PM on the 19th, hoping to witness the exciting challenge.

And that's it for today's news. Stay tuned for more updates from TotemoTech.   Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
