Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on May 17th, 2024. In today's news, we begin with a story from Google. The tech giant recently faced protests from its employees in response to a cloud contract with the Israeli government. The employees staged a demonstration at the Google office, opposing the contract. However, the situation escalated when the police entered the premises to remove the protesters and ended up arresting several participants. As a result, Google made the decision to terminate the employment of over 50 individuals.

Moving on to our next story, researchers from Meiji University, SoftBank, NTT Docomo, and Dwango have conducted a comparative study on the popularity of VTubers and YouTubers. The study focused on three different streaming styles: face reveal, 2D CG avatar, and 3D CG avatar. The researchers aimed to determine which style had a greater impact on viewers. The results of the study were recently published, shedding light on the preferences of the audience.

Switching gears, Canon has announced the development of their flagship camera, the EOS R1. This model will be the first in Canon's EOS R system to feature the RF mount. The company aims to combine their cutting-edge technology, top-class performance, and high durability and reliability to create a mirrorless camera targeted at professionals. The release of the EOS R1 is scheduled for later this year.

In the world of photography, Fujifilm has unveiled the GFX100S II, a new mirrorless camera. This camera boasts a large-format CMOS sensor that is 1.7 times larger than a full-frame sensor. Despite its size, the GFX100S II is remarkably lightweight, weighing only 883 grams. Additionally, it offers the ability to record ProRes footage when connected to an SSD.

Shifting our focus, YAMAP has announced that they will be offering their tracking system, YAMAP Tracking System, free of charge for organizers of trail running events. This system allows for the management of participants' location information during the race, enhancing the overall experience and safety.

In cybersecurity news, pet venture company BioPhilia has reported a potential data breach. They suspect unauthorized access to their cloud server, which may have resulted in the leakage of information from approximately 200,000 accounts. This includes the possibility of plaintext passwords being compromised.

Lastly, Preferred Robotics has introduced a new feature to their autonomous delivery robot, Kachaka. By leveraging a large-scale language model (LLM), the robot can now understand and respond to ambiguous instructions. This advancement enables more natural and conversational interactions with the robot, enhancing its usability.
