Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 19th, 2023. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has announced the release of a new large-scale language model called Llama 2. This model, with 7 billion parameters, is said to be on par with ChatGPT as of March 1st. What's even more impressive is that Meta is offering free usage of Llama 2, including for commercial purposes. This move further intensifies the competition in the AI-generated content space.

In other news, the National Consumer Affairs Center has issued a warning regarding fraudulent automated voice calls. Many people have reported receiving calls from automated systems claiming unpaid bills from companies like NTT Finance. These scam calls aim to deceive individuals into making payments for non-existent debts. It's important to stay vigilant and not provide any personal or financial information over the phone.

The live camera feed has sparked curiosity and discussions among online communities.

In technology news, KDDI, a major Japanese telecommunications company, is bringing satellite broadband to music festivals. They will be using SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service to provide reliable connectivity at events like the FUJI ROCK FESTIVAL '23 and ROCK IN JAPAN FESTIVAL 2023. This move aims to enhance the festival experience for attendees by ensuring a stable and high-speed internet connection.
