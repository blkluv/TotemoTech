Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 18th, 2023. In today's news, researchers from Stanford University and other institutions have conducted a study on the performance of large-scale language models (LLMs). They investigated the impact of changing the length of input context and the position of relevant information on the performance of LLMs. The study found that including 'important information' at the beginning and end of the input text resulted in better outcomes.

In other news, researchers from the National University of Singapore have proposed a method for recording multi-color images directly onto DNA. By incorporating two-dimensional light patterns into DNA, they were able to store and retrieve images with a resolution of 96 pixels. This technique also allows for freezing preservation at -20 degrees Celsius.
