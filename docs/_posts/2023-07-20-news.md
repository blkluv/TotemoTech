### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 20th, 2023. In today's news, we have two significant stories to cover.

First, we turn our attention to a tragic incident that has raised questions about AI governance in child protection. In Tsu City, Mie Prefecture, a 4-year-old girl was physically abused by her parents, resulting in her death. The child welfare office involved in this case had implemented an AI-based system due to a shortage of staff. However, the system determined a temporary protection rate of only 39%, leading to a delay in the child's protection. This incident highlights the need to examine improvements in AI governance from a child protection perspective.

Moving on to our second story, KDDI, one of Japan's leading telecommunications companies, has announced the introduction of international roaming for their online-exclusive plan, povo2.0. Starting from today, povo2.0 users will be able to make voice calls, send SMS, and access data services in over 160 countries and regions. This new feature aims to provide convenience to travelers by allowing them to stay connected even without Wi-Fi. The rollout of international roaming will be gradually implemented, with full availability to all users by August 9th.

That concludes today's news update. Stay tuned for more tech-related stories on TotemoTech.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
