Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on December 24th, 2023. In today's news, we have some interesting stories from the world of technology.

First up, a game called '8th Exit' is creating a buzz online. Have you heard of it? This game has gained popularity through game streaming on platforms like YouTube and social media. It's become a hot topic on the internet, with many people discussing its appeal. But there's also a curious side to this game. Some players have reported experiencing physical discomfort while playing. It seems there may be some unexpected effects on the players' bodies. It's an intriguing development that has caught the attention of gamers and researchers alike.

Next, let's talk about Sanco, a company known for its innovative household electronics. Their latest product, the 'Wearable Heater,' has been making waves in the market. As the temperature drops, staying warm becomes a pressing issue. But rising energy costs have made the choice of heating appliances a crucial decision. Unlike traditional heating methods like air conditioners, the Wearable Heater focuses on warming the individual rather than the entire room, resulting in energy savings. We spoke to Sanco's product manager about the new features of this season's Wearable Heater and how it addresses the needs of consumers.

Moving on, OrioSpec, a Tokyo-based company, has announced the launch of a unique gaming PC. What sets it apart? Well, it's in the shape of a sneaker! The 'CoolerMaster Sneaker X Gaming PC Desktop' is now available for pre-order, with a price tag of 473,000 yen for the standard configuration. This gaming PC combines style and performance, offering gamers a one-of-a-kind experience. It's a fascinating fusion of fashion and technology that is sure to catch the attention of gaming enthusiasts.

In other news, the Japanese government has decided to phase out paper health insurance cards by December 2nd, 2024. The current health insurance cards will be replaced by a unified digital insurance card called 'MyNa Insurance Card.' This move aims to streamline the healthcare system and improve efficiency. The transition to digital cards will provide convenience for both patients and healthcare providers, eliminating the need for physical cards and reducing administrative burdens.

Now, let's talk about anime. The TV anime series 'Zon100: 100 Things I Want to Do Before Becoming a Zombie' is making a comeback. The remaining three episodes, which were on hold, will be aired consecutively on December 25th. In addition, a compilation of the first seven episodes will be available on YouTube. Fans of the series can look forward to the continuation of this thrilling story.

Shifting gears, there's an interesting development in the world of smartphone sales. Recently, electronic stores have been promoting the message 'Don't miss out on buying a smartphone before December 26th!' But what's the reason behind this urgency? It turns out that new regulations on discounts for smartphones will come into effect on December 27th. These regulations aim to create a fairer market for consumers by limiting excessive discount practices. So, if you're planning to buy a new smartphone, you might want to take advantage of the current discounts before the new regulations kick in.

Lastly, we have news from the online media world. Daily Portal Z, a popular internet media platform, has officially become an independent company. The platform, previously under the umbrella of the Tokyu Group, has been transferred to a new company owned by the editor-in-chief, Yushi Hayashi.
