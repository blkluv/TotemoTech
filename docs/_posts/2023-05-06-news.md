Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on May 6th. 

Google has announced the release of its first foldable smartphone, the Pixel Fold, with a video preview on Twitter and a product page on the Google Store. The official launch will be on May 10th at the Google I/O event. 

Microsoft has made improvements to its search engine, Bing, and web browser, Edge, including expanding previously limited preview features to all users with a Microsoft account login. The updates also include enhanced visual capabilities and chat history saving. 

Twitter has announced that government and public service organizations can now use its API for weather alerts, transportation updates, and emergency notifications for free. 

Google has introduced "PassKey" for Google accounts, allowing users to sign in without a password. This feature will also be available for Google Workspace accounts, with the option for administrators to enable PassKey for users during sign-in. 

Amazon's Ring series of smart home security devices has added the Ring Spotlight Cam Plus, a camera with a built-in light for added protection. 

The standard photo editing features on iPhones include hidden functions such as cropping and compositing, which can greatly improve the quality of photos without the need for additional editing apps. 

The National Museum of Nature and Science in Japan has introduced an exhibit titled "The Trajectory of Mammalogy in Japan," which showcases the work of past and present researchers in the field. And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
