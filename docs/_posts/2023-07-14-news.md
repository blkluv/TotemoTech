### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 14th, 2023. In today's news, Google's AI assistant 'Bard' is under scrutiny for its data collection practices. The initial screen of Bard now explicitly states that human reviewers may process conversations with users. Additionally, user location information is constantly being collected. This has raised concerns about privacy and the potential for human review of sensitive data.

Moving on to our next story, Sony has announced the launch of the powerful 'α6700' APS-C camera. This high-end model features the 'BIONZ XR' chip, previously seen only in full-frame α cameras, and an AI processing unit used in the 'α7R V'. These enhancements have improved autofocus capabilities, and the camera can even shoot 4K video at 120 frames per second.

Next, we turn our attention to the security trends in local governments. With the increasing focus on information management, particularly in municipalities handling highly confidential data, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in Japan has been asked about the incidents that local governments are prone to. They emphasize the need for measures to prevent incidents and ensure the security of sensitive information.

Shifting back to Google, the chat AI 'Bard' has received several new features. Users can now generate shareable URLs to allow conversations to be shared externally. Additionally, the AI can read out text responses in audio format, enhancing the user experience.

In other news, JR East Japan has released the 'Train Driver Starter Kit' for train enthusiasts. This kit includes items such as white gloves and route tickets used by JR East train drivers, allowing fans to immerse themselves in the experience.

Moving on, Amazon Business is introducing a new feature that allows users to narrow down the search results for invoice-eligible items. Starting from August 4th, customers will be able to filter and find products that are eligible for invoice issuance.

Shifting gears to education, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in Japan has released guidelines for the use of AI in schools. These guidelines aim to provide a framework for the responsible and effective use of AI in education. They address various aspects, including privacy protection, ethical considerations, and the importance of human involvement.

Lastly, we explore the capabilities of AI in generating math worksheets for middle school students using the AI chat service 'ChatGPT'. By testing the AI with challenging questions and open-ended problems, we can gain insights into its potential and the implications of AI technology. It's an opportunity to reflect on the depth of AI and the implications it has for human learning.
