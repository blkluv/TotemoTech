### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on February 14th, 2024. In today's news, two significant stories have emerged. First, two former employees of a mobile phone sales agency have been arrested on suspicion of iPhone fraud. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police's Second Investigation Division arrested Ryohta Honda, a former employee of the agency from Chiba Prefecture, and Yoshiro Ito, a former security company employee from Kanagawa Prefecture. It is alleged that they deceived the sales agency and ordered 2,600 iPhones under false pretenses. The investigation is ongoing.

Moving on to our second story, GMO Internet Group has announced plans to invest 10 billion yen in the procurement of GPU servers and related equipment. The investment will be made through a partnership with NVIDIA, a US-based company with whom GMO Internet Group entered into a contract in December 2023. This move is seen as a strategic step in anticipation of future support from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.
