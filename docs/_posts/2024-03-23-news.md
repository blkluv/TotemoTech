First up, fans of the popular indie game '8th Exit' will be thrilled to hear that the details of its highly anticipated sequel will be revealed later this month. According to reports, the game's developer plans to unveil the sequel's details by opening a store page on Steam. While the release date is still a bit further down the road, this announcement is sure to generate a lot of excitement among gamers.

In other news, Toyota has announced its plans to establish a new headquarters in the Shinagawa area of Tokyo by the fiscal year 2029. The automotive giant has acquired the land previously owned by Keikyu Corporation in the west exit of Shinagawa Station to create a new office base. This move not only showcases Toyota's commitment to innovation and mobility, but also reflects the company's long-term vision for growth.

Moving on to the world of entertainment, anime fans will be delighted to hear that a theme park based on the popular manga series 'Dragon Ball' is set to be built in Saudi Arabia. This will be the world's first 'Dragon Ball' theme park, featuring iconic attractions such as a 70-meter-tall replica of the 'Shenron' dragon. The announcement has already sparked excitement among fans worldwide, and it will be interesting to see how this unique collaboration between East and West unfolds.

In other news, the iconic commercial complex 'Shinjuku Alta' in Tokyo's Shinjuku Station East Exit area will be closing its doors at the end of February 2025. 'Shinjuku Alta' gained fame through its association with the popular TV show 'Waratte Iitomo!' and has been a beloved shopping destination for many years. While the closure marks the end of an era, it also signals the potential for new developments in the ever-evolving landscape of Tokyo.

Next, a recent controversy surrounding the use of AI-generated illustrations in merchandise for the 'Precure' anime series has been making headlines. The official 'Precure' X account (@precure_15th) took to social media to address rumors that AI was being used to create the artwork. The account stated that they do not use AI-generated illustrations in their merchandise. This clarification comes after some users speculated that AI technology was involved, sparking a debate about the ethics and implications of AI in the creative industry.

Lastly, NTT Docomo has announced the upcoming discontinuation of its 'i-mode' and 'FOMA' services, scheduled for March 31st, 2026. The telecommunications company has created a dedicated website to inform users about the plans and services that will be affected by the discontinuation.
