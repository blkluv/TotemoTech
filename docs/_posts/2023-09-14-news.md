### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on September 14th, 2023. In today's news, we have two significant stories to cover.

First, let's talk about the latest iPhone release. Apple recently announced the new iPhone 15 Pro, and it has sparked a discussion online. People are surprised by the price difference between the iPhone 15 Pro and the MacBook Air. When comparing the 1TB models, the iPhone 15 Pro is approximately 30,000 yen more expensive than the MacBook Air. This goes against the conventional wisdom that iPhones are cheaper than MacBooks. It will be interesting to see how this pricing strategy affects the market.

Moving on to our second story, the Tokyo Film Lab's closure is causing concern among filmmakers and fans. The renowned post-production company announced that it will be ending its operations at the end of November. What's alarming is that they have informed the rights holders that if they don't receive contact by the end of October regarding the return of film originals in their possession, those originals might be disposed of. This puts around 20,000 valuable film originals at risk of being lost forever. It's a heartbreaking situation for the film industry, and efforts are being made to reach out to the rights holders and prevent any loss.

That's all we have for today's news. Stay tuned for more updates on the latest tech developments.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
