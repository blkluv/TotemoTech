Moving on to sports, AbemaTV's CTO has revealed the behind-the-scenes infrastructure that kept the streaming of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Japan stable. It's an interesting read for those who are curious about the technical side of things...

It's unfortunate to hear about such incidents happening to content creators...

NTT East and NTT West have announced their plan to discontinue their "Flets-ADSL" service in areas where "Flets Hikari" (fiber optic service) is not available due to a decrease in users. They are encouraging users to switch to mobile services instead...

The "white ROM discount" is under scrutiny by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications' Competition Rule Verification Working Group. The excessive discount amounts have led to calls for regulation, which may result in the disappearance of the "1 yen smartphone." The Fair Trade Commission has also expressed concerns about the possible violation of antitrust laws...

Digital Garage and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Club have announced the launch of their B2B payment service, "DGFT Invoice Card Payment," for Diners Club cardholders. It's good to see more options for B2B payment solutions...

During the Golden Week period, some procedures, such as changing the name on a My Number Card, will be temporarily suspended due to system maintenance...

Lastly, MAMORIO has announced the release of a trading card case, "TRILITH MAMORIO model," equipped with their "MAMORIO" lost item tag. The tag allows for location tracking via smartphone, which could be useful in preventing theft or loss of high-value cards.
