### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on May 14th, 2023.

[Canon](/companies/canon) has announced a new addition to its Powershot series, the V10, which is a VLOG camera. This new camera is different from its previous compact digital cameras and is expected to compete with [Sony](/companies/sony)'s VLOGCAM.

Meanwhile, Meta has launched an AI Sandbox for ad creators, which allows them to experiment with copywriting and image generation tools. On the other hand, [pixiv](/companies/pixiv) has banned AI-generated requests on its paid request service, following a rise in requests for AI-generated works.

In other news, Barumuda's mobile phone business has ended, with its CEO admitting that it was due to their own lack of ability. The company had attempted to challenge the smartphone industry but failed to gain traction.

Furthermore, [Rakuten Mobile](/companies/rakuten-mobile) has strengthened its roaming agreement with [KDDI](/companies/kddi), launching a new plan called the Rakuten Strongest Plan. The company aims to gradually end its roaming contract and move to its own network.

Lastly, a report by Futurewoods, the operator of the sales support tool FutureSearch, found that sales texts with fewer words and more concise language tend to have higher click-through rates than longer ones. 

And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
