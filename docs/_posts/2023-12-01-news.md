Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on December 1st, 2023. In today's news, Google has released its ranking of the top uses for its AI chatbot 'Bard' in 2023. The top use in Japan was for 'research'. Bard allows users to include images in their questions and answers, making it a versatile tool. Moving on, SBI Securities has announced that it will offer free exchange fees for USD/JPY currency trading starting from December 1st. This move aims to attract more customers to their foreign exchange services. Next, VTuber agency 'Hololive Production' has announced the discontinuation of its website 'Hololive Official Fan Club' due to 'various circumstances'. The fan club provided exclusive content and interactions for fans of their virtual YouTubers. Shifting gears, we have a special year-end recommendation for digital single-lens reflex cameras. This selection is not limited to beginners or entry-level users but offers a wide range of options for different preferences. Now, let's take a look at the workspaces of employees at IBM Japan and its subsidiary, IBM Digital Services, through photos and their comments. This gives us a glimpse into the desk environments of IT professionals. And finally, following the closure of Nishikawa Electronic Components in Akihabara, Chigusa Electric Trading has announced that it will take over the business of selling screws in the area. They will continue to serve the community and ensure that 'screws will not be lost from Akihabara'. That concludes today's news from TotemoTech.
