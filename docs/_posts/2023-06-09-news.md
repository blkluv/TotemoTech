### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on June 9th, 2023. Security firms have reported that account information for 30 major Japanese manufacturers has been leaked onto the dark web, highlighting the vulnerability of the manufacturing industry. In other news, researchers from Tokyo University, the University of Limerick, and the Austrian Institute of Science and Technology have developed a framework for creating stealth designs for any object by optimizing the surface's recursive reflection while maintaining its original shape. Meanwhile, Google DeepMind has announced that its AI algorithm, AlphaDev, has discovered a faster sorting algorithm than those developed by humans, which could lead to up to a 70% increase in speed. Other news includes a report from researchers at the University of Warwick who have identified a vulnerability in hidden cameras that could allow them to be remotely accessed and monitored, as well as a survey from Weathernews showing that nearly 70% of Japanese people experience physical symptoms such as headaches and nausea during bad weather, known as 'weather pain'. Additionally, Fujifilm has announced that it will resume orders for color negative and reversal film, as well as some Instax products, but with a maximum price increase of 88%. Finally, Sega Toys has developed a camera aimed at children that allows them to easily create viral videos, while a futuristic game called 'Air Touch Othello' that floats the game board in mid-air has been released as a completely contactless gaming experience during the pandemic.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
