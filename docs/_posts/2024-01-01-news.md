In today's news, Aniplex is set to broadcast a 480-second (8-minute) TV commercial for the movie 'Kizumonogatari - Koyomi Vamp' on New Year's Day. This will be the longest TV commercial in Japanese history. Moving on, let's talk about security precautions for the new year. As we enter 2024, it's important to be mindful of IT security.
