Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on October 14th, 2023. In today's news, Tiger Corporation, known for their innovative kitchen appliances, has developed a unique rice cooker called 'Magic Kamado Gohan' that uses fire instead of electricity as the heat source. The inspiration behind this development was the concept of 'mottainai,' which means 'waste not' in Japanese. The company aims to position this rice cooker as a disaster preparedness item, especially in commemoration of their 100th anniversary and the 100th anniversary of the Great Kanto Earthquake. They envision it being useful not only for camping enthusiasts but also for schools and educational purposes. We had the opportunity to speak with the project leader to learn more about the development process and their goals for the product.

Moving on to our next story, Hoshino Resorts has announced a new accommodation plan called 'Smartphone-Free Stay.' This plan aims to encourage guests to disconnect from their smartphones during their stay. Upon check-in, guests will have to seal their smartphones in a locked case and write a pledge to embrace a smartphone-free experience. Instead of relying on cameras and social media, the resort will provide guests with a notebook to capture their memories. This initiative by Hoshino Resorts reflects a growing trend of digital detox and the desire to enjoy a more mindful and present travel experience.
