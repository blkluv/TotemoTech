Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on September 24th, 2023. In today's news, Fujitsu has announced the relocation of its headquarters from the Shiodome office in Tokyo to Kawasaki City. The company plans to vacate the Shiodome City Center by September 30th, 2024, with the management department moving to the main office in Kawasaki's Nakahara Ward, and the sales department relocating to the 'Fujitsu Uvance Kawasaki Tower' in the city's Saiwai Ward.

Moving on to our next story, Microsoft has integrated its 'Copilot' AI feature into the upcoming Windows 11 update. Copilot, a support feature powered by AI, has been used for tasks such as web searches and document creation. The integration will be rolled out gradually alongside the release of Windows 11 on September 26th.

We also have news from Seiyu, where certain stores are experiencing shortages and out-of-stock items due to a system switch. Seiyu announced that the transition of their core systems has resulted in inventory shortages and limited availability of food and daily necessities in some stores. Although they haven't disclosed specific store names or numbers, multiple locations have been affected.

Next, let's talk about the impact of image-generating AI on doujinshi, self-published Japanese works. Recently, there has been an increase in the use of image-generating AI at doujinshi events. I came across a doujinshi that explained how to generate illustrations using AI for those who are unable to draw. This trend is gaining popularity among aspiring artists.

Moving on, researchers from the UK have developed a method to identify specific keys based on the sound of typing during video conferences. Even if you type quietly, the sound of keystrokes can still be heard. The researchers claim an accuracy rate of over 90% in identifying the keys pressed based on the typing sounds. This discovery raises concerns about potential security threats during virtual meetings.

Shifting gears, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in Japan has revised the previously announced 'uniform 40,000 yen discount' on smartphones. The ministry took into account the discussions and explanations provided by experts during the verification of policies such as the complete separation of communication fees and device costs. The report, titled 'Verification of Competition Rules 2023,' was published on September 11th, 2023.

Lastly, let's discuss a technique called 'grounding' that aims to address the weaknesses of AI-generated hallucinations. Large language models (LLMs) used in AI often produce nonsensical outputs known as hallucinations. For companies using AI to explain their products and services to customers, these hallucinations can damage the company's reputation. Grounding techniques are being explored to mitigate this issue and ensure accurate and reliable AI-generated content.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
