Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on September 19th, 2023. In today's news, DJI has launched the fourth generation of its OSMO Action camera, featuring a larger sensor. The new OSMO Action 4 maintains the same look, size, and weight as its predecessor, but if you take a closer look at the lens, you'll notice that it now has a 1/1.3" sensor.

Moving on to our next story, Blackmagic Design has introduced a new camera app called Blackmagic Camera for the iPhone. This free app brings professional features similar to those found in the company's video cameras to the iPhone, including 10-bit 4K ProRes support.

In gaming news, PlayStation Plus recently underwent a significant price increase of over 30%.

Shifting gears, the popularity of onigiri, or Japanese rice balls, has been on the rise. To capitalize on this trend, Takara Tomy Arts has released the "Ultimate Onigiri" maker, which promises to create fluffy and delicious onigiri similar to those found in specialty shops. We invited a professional chef to try it out and were impressed by the results.

Lastly, let's take a look at some unique research studies that could potentially be candidates for the next Ig Nobel Prize. The Ig Nobel Prize recognizes unusual and humorous scientific achievements. Some of the notable studies include a virtual reality simulation that replicates the sensation of insects crawling in your mouth and an AI system that can diagnose diarrhea.
