Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on September 10th, 2023. In today's news, the president of Sompo Japan Insurance, Gicho Shirakawa, has resigned following an insurance claim scandal involving Big Motor. Sompo Japan Insurance announced on September 8th that Shirakawa would step down in response to fraudulent insurance claims made by Big Motor. During a press conference, Shirakawa admitted that the company did not have a system in place to detect and alert about such fraudulent activities.

Moving on to our next story, Cloudflare, a US-based company, has unveiled a new service called Cloudflare One Data Protection Suite. This suite aims to address data leakage and source code loss by providing a unified platform for managing and visualizing corporate data scattered across various locations. With this service, companies can reduce the risk of data leaks and protect their source code.

In other news, a collaborative research group consisting of Advanced Accelerator Systems, Danafom, and Juntendo University has developed a software called AAS-G1 that can analyze the entire human genome in less than 10 minutes. What sets this software apart is that it can run on a regular computer equipped with an IA processor, without the need for dedicated FPGAs or GPUs.

Next up, Audi, a subsidiary of Volkswagen Group, has introduced its new electric vehicle, the Q6 e-tron, at the IAA Mobility 2023 exhibition in Munich. This mid-sized SUV type EV is the first to adopt the Porsche-developed Premium Platform Electric (PPE), which enables it to use an 800V electrical system.

Shifting gears, the Japanese government has decided to revise the Basic Policy for Standardization of Local Government Information Systems, which sets a specific deadline of the end of fiscal year 2025 for the unification and standardization of local government information systems. While some deadlines have been relaxed, there are still two remaining challenges to be addressed.

In the construction industry, Taisei Corporation and Hitachi Group have initiated the development of a virtual approval system called the Construction Approval Metaverse. This system allows users to refer to virtual buildings created based on BIM data and conduct meetings and approval processes within the system, streamlining the construction approval workflow.

Lastly, WAE Technologies, formerly known as Williams Advanced Engineering, has showcased its battery management software product called Elysia at the IAA Mobility 2023. This software is designed for electric vehicles and stationary storage batteries, and it promises to improve the range of electric vehicles by 10%.
