Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on May 23rd, 2024. In today's news, NHK Giken, the NHK Broadcasting Technology Research Institute, announced the development of a flexible and stretchable full-color LED display. They used rubber substrates and liquid metal to create this innovative display. This breakthrough could lead to new possibilities in the field of flexible and wearable technology.

Moving on to our next story, UUUM, ANYCOLOR, and KABAA have established a 'Defamation Countermeasures Subcommittee' under the 'Defamation Countermeasures Study Group' of the Creator Economy Association. This subcommittee aims to address issues related to defamation and cyberbullying. With the support of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department's Criminal Investigation Division, the three companies will work together to combat online harassment, explore damage claims, and enhance cooperation with law enforcement agencies.

Next up, let's talk about the future of live streaming with 5G technology. Sony's 'PDT-FP1' 5G transmitter, released in March 2024, has gained popularity as an accessory for their digital camera series 'α'. While it is marketed as a consumer product, it is actually a professional-grade device. This 5G transmitter opens up new possibilities for high-quality live streaming, enabling users to capture and transmit videos with the same quality as professional broadcasting.

In other news, Microsoft is introducing a new feature called 'AI Recorder' in their RPA and low-code tool 'Power Automate'. This feature allows users to teach the AI by giving voice commands and demonstrating on-screen actions. By recording and automating PC operations through AI, the new feature aims to provide more flexibility in automating repetitive tasks.

Moving on to the gaming industry, G-MODE has announced the release of a remake of the popular 1980s mystery adventure game 'Vanishing in Okhotsk' on September 12th. The remake will be available on the Nintendo Switch, and the package will also include the original Famicom version, allowing players to experience both the classic and modern versions of the game.

In the world of software engineering, CyberAgent has made two training materials for new graduate engineers available for free. The materials, titled 'Fundamentals and Strategies of System Operations' and 'Practical Training on Observability', provide insights into essential aspects of system operations and observability in software development.

And finally, AEON Pay, the code payment service offered by AEON, now supports bill payments. Users can now conveniently pay their utility bills from the comfort of their homes using AEON Pay. This new feature simplifies the payment process and provides greater convenience for AEON Pay users.
