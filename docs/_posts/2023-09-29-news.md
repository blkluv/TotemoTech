Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on September 29th, 2023. In today's news, Google Research and Sizzle AI have announced the development of a model that can calculate the relevance of scientific papers across multiple languages. This model measures the similarity of scientific papers written in different languages and proposes a dataset that includes a large number of multilingual papers.

Moving on to our next story, researchers at Microsoft have unveiled DeepSpeed-VisualChat, an AI model capable of processing multiple images and text. This large-scale language model (LLM) demonstrates excellent scalability, with the ability to handle multiple images and text simultaneously.

Now, let's shift our focus to the world of fitness trackers. Fitbit, under the umbrella of Google, has introduced the Fitbit Charge 6. This new fitness tracker features the return of physical buttons and offers the convenience of using Google Maps and Suica-compatible Fitbit Pay. Additionally, the battery life has been extended.

In other news, Xiaomi has announced the launch of the Xiaomi TV A Pro, a tuner-less television, in Japan. This smart TV is compatible with Google TV and offers various smart features. KDDI will have exclusive rights to sell the Xiaomi TV A Pro starting from mid-October.

Next up, Apple has updated its support information page with tips on how to clean the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. Apple advises users not to rely on image searches to identify mushrooms, as it recently came to light that individuals in Tokyo suffered from mushroom poisoning after misidentifying toxic mushrooms using image searches.

Shifting gears, let's talk about streaming services. Walt Disney Japan has announced that starting in November, the pricing plans for Disney+ will be updated. The current 990 yen plan will be split into the Standard Plan and the Premium Plan, priced at 990 yen and 1320 yen per month, respectively. Existing subscribers will be automatically upgraded to the Premium Plan.

That wraps up today's news from TotemoTech. Stay tuned for more updates on the latest tech developments.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
