Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on December 12th, 2023. In today's news, we have some interesting stories to cover. First up, there's some controversy surrounding Amazon's popular 'Ultrasonic Cleaner.' Customers have been discussing their experiences with the product on platforms like X (formerly known as Twitter), and it seems that the cleaner may not be as effective as advertised. Some customers have even gone as far as purchasing the product and dismantling it for a closer look.

Moving on to our next story, the management of the popular VTuber group 'Nijisanji' has issued a warning about impersonation fraud. It appears that scammers have been pretending to be Nijisanji VTubers and deceiving fans into giving them money and goods. The company has received reports of financial and material losses resulting from these fraudulent activities.
