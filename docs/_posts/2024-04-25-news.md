### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on April 25th, 2024. In today's news, we have two significant stories to cover. First, accessory retailer 'Parts Club' and other accessory-related businesses operated by Endless in Tokyo's Taito Ward announced that their servers were infected with the 'LockBit' ransomware. They attribute the cause of the infection to a mistake by StarTier, a security solution provider based in Shinjuku Ward.

Moving on to our second story, CyberAgent announced their financial results for the second quarter of the fiscal year ending in September 2024. The media business, including 'ABEMA,' achieved a quarterly net profit for the first time. The consolidated revenue increased by 12.4% to 408.25 billion yen compared to the same period last year, with an operating profit of 27.355 billion yen, an increase of 56.0%, and a net profit of 9.866 billion yen, a growth of 240.4%.

Next, we have a story from the gaming industry. A training document for new employees of a game company has been published, cautioning against using inappropriate test strings. The document highlights the risks of leakage when test strings, such as 'poop,' are casually inserted. It provides examples and emphasizes the importance of maintaining professionalism in test environments.

Moving to the tech world, Daikin has released the results of their investigation into the use of wet towels on air conditioner outdoor units, a popular energy-saving technique discussed on social media. The study compared the performance of units with and without wet towels and shared the findings.

Shifting our focus to education, a survey conducted by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology revealed that approximately 80% of public elementary, junior high, and high schools in Japan have insufficient internet communication environments. Larger schools are particularly vulnerable, posing challenges to the digitalization of education.

In other news, NHK, the national broadcasting organization, has decided to air popular episodes from the old 'Project X' series once a month. Following the success of the revived 'New Project X: Challengers,' NHK aims to bring back episodes that received significant attention in the past.

Lastly, Sakura Internet has announced the launch of the 'Sakura Cloud Certification' exam, scheduled for this summer. The certification aims to assess knowledge and skills related to their cloud service, 'Sakura Cloud.' The difficulty level of the exam is described as slightly higher than the 'IT Passport' certification.

That wraps up today's news from TotemoTech. Stay tuned for more updates on the latest tech developments.   Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
