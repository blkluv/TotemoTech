Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on June 26th, 2023. In today's news, AI technology pushes the boundaries of creativity in the world of doujinshi. An AI-generated doujinshi called 'Despair Izakaya' was created using ChatGPT to come up with unconventional izakaya menu items, and an image generation AI was used to create illustrations in the style of an izakaya menu. However, the process turned out to be more labor-intensive than expected, blurring the line between AI and human creativity.

Moving on to entertainment news, the finale of the anime 'Mobile Suit Gundam: Mercury's Witch' faced a delay in its streaming availability on certain video streaming platforms. The delay was attributed to production reasons, with the streaming start being postponed. Fans of the series had to wait patiently for the conclusion of this popular anime.

In other news, a study conducted by researchers at MIT revealed that third-party tools used to detect bot accounts on Twitter are not accurate. The study demonstrated that these tools are not reliable in identifying bot accounts accurately. This raises concerns about the effectiveness of current bot detection methods on social media platforms.

Next, researchers at the University of Maryland College Park have developed an AI that can determine what someone is looking at by analyzing the reflection in their eyes. The learning model proposed by the researchers reconstructs the images reflected in the eyes into 3D scenes. By capturing the reflection multiple times, the AI can recreate the images in a 3D format. This technology has potential applications in various fields such as security and human-computer interaction.

Shifting gears, let's talk about coffee. The Tiger 'Syphonista' coffee maker has gained popularity for its unique automatic siphon brewing method. In an interview with Tiger's project manager, Mr. Izumi Shuusou, he explained why they chose to incorporate the siphon brewing method into an automatic coffee maker and revealed the secrets behind the aroma and flavor of the coffee produced by the Syphonista.

In anime news, the latest episode of 'Mobile Suit Gundam: Mercury's Witch' also faced a delay in its streaming availability on certain platforms. The reason for the delay was attributed to production reasons, similar to the previous delay. Fans eagerly awaiting the latest installment of this popular anime had to exercise patience once again.

In a more light-hearted story, a manga artist recently purchased a trackball and shared their positive experience with it. The artist highlighted the improved usability of the trackball, particularly when it comes to navigating YouTube. This demonstrates how even small changes in tools can have a significant impact on the creative process.

Lastly, Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced the launch of the 'AWS Generative AI Innovation Center' program, with an investment of approximately 14 billion yen. The program aims to support customers in building and utilizing generative AI for service development and business efficiency. AWS recognizes the growing importance of generative AI and aims to empower its customers in harnessing its potential.
