In other news, Big Camera has introduced a new theme song. While the closing jingle remains the same, the lyrics and melody have been refreshed. The new lyrics are inspired by Ikebukuro and there are plans to consider local versions in the future.

Shifting gears, a professional photographer discusses the use of AI in creative works and the conflicting opinions surrounding it. As AI-generated content becomes more prevalent, creators are grappling with how to incorporate AI while maintaining the authenticity and impact of their own work.

This change aims to make it easier for domestic cloud services that were previously unable to participate to enter the market.
