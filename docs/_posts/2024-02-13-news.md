Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on February 13th, 2024. In today's news, researchers from the National University of Singapore have proposed a novel attack method called 'SpiKey.' By using a smartphone's microphone to capture the sound produced when inserting a key into a lock, the researchers can deduce the shape of the key solely based on the acoustic signal. This attack raises concerns about the security of traditional locks and highlights the importance of developing more secure alternatives.

Moving on to our next story, a professor from Hakodate Future University has shared an AI-based horse betting strategy in the journal 'Information Processing.' The article provides insights into the factors that information scientists should consider when using AI to predict profitable horse racing bets. This highlights the growing role of AI in various domains, including the gambling industry.

Next, let's talk about the surprising reaction of a manga artist to the hit movie 'Gundam SEED.' The film, titled 'Mobile Suit Gundam SEED FREEDOM,' has received a strong start, marking the first completely new installment in the series in approximately 20 years. The positive reception has caught the attention of the manga artist, who expressed their astonishment at the movie's success. It seems that 'Gundam SEED' continues to captivate audiences even after all these years.

Shifting gears, the Pokémon Company has collaborated with a shogi AI company to develop an AI system specialized in Pokémon battles called 'Pokemon Battle Scope' (PBS). This AI will be utilized in the live streaming of the 'Ryuo Tournament,' a prestigious shogi competition. The integration of AI into Pokémon battles demonstrates the evolving landscape of both gaming and AI technology.

In other news, Chatwork, a popular business communication platform, has announced a name change. The company will rebrand itself as 'kubell' starting from July 1st. The new name is derived from the phrase 'to add fuel to the fire' and reflects the company's commitment to enhancing communication and collaboration among teams.

Moving on, a male employee of a real estate sales company, identified as Kazuma Kataoka, has been arrested by the Cybercrime Division of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police for unauthorized access to the corporate business card management system, 'Sansan.' Kataoka allegedly impersonated an employee of the system's operating company and obtained user IDs and passwords from unsuspecting users. The motive behind the illegal access is believed to be related to business operations, although Kataoka denies the allegations.

Lastly, in response to the Noto Peninsula earthquake in the sixth year of the Reiwa era, the editorial department of Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump has decided to offer free access to four issues of the magazine, including 'Weekly Shonen Jump,' through their official app. This initiative aims to provide support to areas affected by the earthquake and ensure that readers in those regions can enjoy the latest manga releases despite distribution delays.
