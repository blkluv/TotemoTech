### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on June 23rd, 2023. In today's news, we have two significant stories to cover. First, in Shibusshi City, Kagoshima Prefecture, there is a potential credit card information leak on the 'Shibusshi Furusato Tax Payment Site.' It is suspected that 910 credit card details may have been compromised due to a vulnerability in the site. The attackers exploited a cross-site scripting vulnerability and modified the site to steal card information during payment transactions.

Moving on to our second story, NTT Docomo announced a new pricing plan called 'Ilmo.' While the details were not discussed during the official announcement, the service site reveals that 'Ilmo' is designed to face communication speed restrictions before other plans in congested situations. This means that users subscribed to 'Ilmo' may experience slower internet speeds compared to other plans during peak times.

In other news, a non-official fan site called 'ENninja' is gaining attention for providing English learning resources using videos from the overseas VTuber group 'NIJISANJI EN.' The site utilizes VTubers' livestream videos to explain English expressions actually used by the VTubers themselves.

SESAME, a relatively well-established brand in the smart lock industry, has released a new model called 'SESAME 5.' Priced at only 3,980 yen, it targets parents who want to prevent their children from forgetting their keys. The affordability of the product makes it an attractive option for beginners in the smart lock market.

Cosplayer Eneko commented on an AI-generated gravure image that closely resembles her on her official Twitter account. She expressed her feeling of being 'eaten up' by AI, jokingly stating that there is almost nothing left of her except for her bones.

StudySup, an English learning app by Recruit, has published a 'Resume Guide for Web Engineers' on their company blog. The guide aims to assist web engineers in writing effective resumes to resolve early mismatches in job applications.

In a security incident, Niigata University's mail server was illegally accessed, resulting in approximately 1.51 million spam emails being sent.

Lastly, Sumitomo Corporation has announced the adoption of AWS for their common IT infrastructure, known as the 'SC Digital Infrastructure.' With the goal of promoting digital transformation, Sumitomo is migrating existing systems from traditional private cloud environments to AWS, covering approximately 900 group companies.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
