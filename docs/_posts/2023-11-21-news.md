First up, Bandai Namco Filmworks has announced that they will be producing a VR movie based on the popular anime series 'Mobile Suit Gundam.' The movie, titled 'Mobile Suit Gundam: Silver Ashes,' will be a collaboration between Bandai Namco and a French production company. Fans can look forward to experiencing the world of Gundam like never before.

Moving on to financial news, KDDI has announced that its subsidiary, Soracom, has restarted the process of applying for an initial public offering (IPO) on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Soracom had previously applied for an IPO in 2022 but withdrew the application earlier this year. The decision to resume the IPO process is based on the company's assessment of the economic environment and market trends.

Next, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in Japan has decided to expand the online payment system for local taxes, including national health insurance premiums. The system, called 'eLTAX,' aims to improve convenience for residents and businesses by allowing them to make online payments for not only taxes but also various public fees. The ministry aims to launch the system no later than September 2026.

Altman, previously associated with OpenAI, and Brockman will be joining Microsoft, bringing their expertise and contributions to the company's endeavors.

Turning to a legal matter, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department's Narcotics and Firearms Control Division has arrested two individuals, including YouTuber Ren Konno, also known as 'Gutsch,' on suspicion of violating the Stimulants Control Act. The arrest was made as part of the division's efforts to crack down on drug-related offenses. The police are continuing their investigation into the case.

Lastly, the VTuber agency 'Noripro' has announced that four of its VTubers, namely Shiro Yuki, Aimiya Miruku, Himesaki Yuzuru, and Nekose Noshin, will be graduating from the agency on December 31st. Starting from January 2024, each VTuber will pursue their individual activities. This marks a new chapter for these talented individuals as they explore new opportunities in the VTuber industry.
