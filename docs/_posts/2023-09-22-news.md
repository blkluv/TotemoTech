Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on September 22nd, 2023. In today's news, Morinaga Milk Industry announced that they will be opening a game center called 'Pino Gessen' in Shibuya, Tokyo on October 5th. This is part of a promotional campaign for their popular ice cream brand, 'Pino'. The game center will occupy three floors and feature various 'Pino' themed games. Moving on to our next story, Toshiba has announced that the tender offer bid (TOB) conducted by TBJH Co., Ltd. has been successful. As a result, Toshiba will be delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Nagoya Stock Exchange, following the listing criteria. Now, let's turn our attention to the Japan Fair Trade Commission. They have published a report on the investigation into the practices of news portal platforms that aggregate articles from media companies. The report suggests that Yahoo! Japan, which operates the news portal 'Yahoo! News', may have a dominant position in the market. Finally, in the world of gaming, the smartphone game 'Monster Hunter Now' developed by Niantic has surpassed 5 million downloads within one week of its release. This demonstrates the popularity of the game among mobile gamers. Shifting gears to technology, the newly released iPhone 15 series features a USB-C connector. Early testing reveals the versatility of the USB-C port and its ability to connect various devices. On the education front, Kwansei Gakuin University has announced the full adoption of collaboration tools such as Slack, Box, Zoom, and Okta. This initiative aims to enhance remote learning and work capabilities for students and faculty, as well as strengthen security through features provided by the services. And finally, in the world of animation, Studio Ghibli has announced that it will become a subsidiary of Nippon Television Holdings.
