### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on August 8th, 2023. In today's news, the iconic 1970s anime 'UFO Robo Grendizer' is set to make a comeback after 50 years. The anime will be revived as 'Grendizer U' and will be released on various platforms in 2024.

In other news, the Information-Technology Promotion Agency (IPA) has announced that the 'IT Passport' exam will now include questions related to Generative AI. This change will be effective from the April 2024 exam.

Moving on, Yuray Pro, the production company behind 'Ultraseven,' has developed a voice synthesis AI that can replicate the voices of the characters Moroboshi Dan and Yuzuri Anne from the 1967 tokusatsu drama. This development is expected to enhance the fan experience and bring nostalgia to the series.

Next up, a manga app called 'Sunday Webry' has released the 'Adachi Mitsuru Character Memory Game,' which has gained attention online for being too challenging. Users have been discussing the difficulty of the game since its release on August 6th.

In other news, a book titled 'TDK Cassette Tape Maniacs' has been released by Futaba-sha. The book covers the history of TDK cassette tapes and is priced at 1,980 yen.

Shifting gears, the crowdfunding campaign by the National Museum of Nature and Science, which started on August 7th, has surpassed its initial goal of 100 million yen in less than a day. The campaign has received over 5,000 supportive comments.

Lastly, Tokyo Metro plans to conduct a pilot experiment for 'credit card touch payment' and QR code boarding. Starting from the fiscal year 2024, passengers will be able to use their credit cards for touch payment when boarding Tokyo Metro trains. The results of the pilot experiment will also be considered for implementing post-payment services using credit cards. More details will be announced when the experiment begins.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
