### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on June 7th, 2023. Apple has unveiled its new MR headset, the Vision Pro, at the WWDC23 event. The headset features futuristic functions that remind some of SF anime. However, the company did not mention the words 'VR' or 'metaverse' during the presentation. In other news, Tomy Arts has announced a collaboration with Honda to release a plush toy that plays the engine sound of the NSX. Meanwhile, Eisai Group is investigating a ransomware attack on its servers, and Sansan has increased the starting salary for new employees to 5.6 million yen per year to attract top talent and accelerate business growth.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
