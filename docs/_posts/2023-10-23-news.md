Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on October 23rd, 2023. In today's news, NHK's business program 'Professional: Work Style' has made history by featuring an anime protagonist for the first time.

Next, we have an interesting story about a manga artist who claims to be a watermelon craftsman. Sadataro-san, who got hooked on the watermelon game after watching a VTuber's gaming commentary, was able to consistently create watermelons at one point. However, he seems to be going through a bit of a slump lately.

Moving on, Canon recently held its 'Canon Expo 2023' event, showcasing its latest technologies and solutions. One notable exhibit was the display of two satellites that Canon had launched. These satellites were equipped with Canon's own DSLR cameras, demonstrating their commitment to pushing the boundaries of imaging technology.

In other news, the Orionid meteor shower, also known as the Orionids, reached its peak on the night of October 21st to the early morning of October 22nd.

Shifting gears, a court in Tokyo ruled against the author of the novel 'Dragon Quest V,' Kumisaori-san, in a lawsuit regarding the unauthorized alteration and use of the protagonist's name, Luca, and public appeals in a movie adaptation. The court dismissed the plaintiff's claims against Square Enix and others.
