Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on September 12th, 2023. MONET Technologies announced that they will be operating an electric mobility called 'Neko Bus' around the 'Aichi Expo Memorial Park' where 'Ghibli Park' is located. The Neko Bus is inspired by the iconic cat-shaped bus from Studio Ghibli's animated film 'My Neighbor Totoro'. It is set to start operating within the current fiscal year.

In collaboration with the movie 'City Hunter: Angel Dust', S.RIDE, the taxi dispatch service, has introduced a new feature called 'Get Wild' in their taxi app. Users can now experience a ride that resembles the action-packed world of the movie. This collaboration aims to provide a unique and exciting transportation experience for fans of the film.

HIGHBALL, a Singapore-based company, has launched a Chrome extension called 'Vme!' that allows users to have video calls with customizable avatars and voices. The extension is compatible with popular chat tools such as Discord and Google Meet. Users can choose their favorite avatar and speak through it during video calls, adding a fun and personalized touch to their virtual meetings.

Reports of phishing attempts impersonating the My Number Point Office have been increasing. Scammers send emails claiming that the My Number Point will expire soon and direct recipients to fake websites. They deceive users into inputting personal information, including credit card details, addresses, and names. It is important to stay vigilant and verify the authenticity of any emails or websites requesting personal information.

A recent article about PayPay's charging fees has caused confusion. Starting from September 1st, PayPay charging fees will only apply to the second charge onwards when using the 'SoftBank/Wi-Fi Mobile Consolidated Payment' option, which allows users to combine their monthly mobile phone bills with PayPay charges. The fee amounts to 2.5% of the transaction.

NBC Universal Entertainment has announced that there are issues with the 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray version of the movie 'The Super Mario Brothers Movie' released on September 6th. The Dolby Atmos audio, which was supposed to be included, is only available in 5.1 channel surround sound. The company will provide an exchange service for customers who wish to receive the correct version.

In commemoration of 'Public Telephone Day' on September 11th, it has been reported that the number of public telephones will decrease significantly in the coming years. With the rise of mobile phones and the decrease in demand, it is estimated that the number of public telephones will be reduced to one-third of the current amount. While public telephones have played a crucial role during disasters and communication outages, their presence is gradually diminishing.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
