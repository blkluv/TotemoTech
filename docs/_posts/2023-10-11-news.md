### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on October 11th, 2023. In today's news, Adobe announced an update to their software Illustrator at their annual conference, Adobe MAX 2023. One of the new features introduced is 'Vector Generation from Text', which allows users to generate vector images based on prompts. With just a few inputs, users can create vector images that match their desired style.

Moving on to automotive news, the new version of the Tesla Model 3 has been unveiled. As an owner of the previous model, I am particularly interested in the changes and improvements. The new model was showcased to the media on September 8th, and I will take a closer look at its features through photos.

Next, let's talk about banking. The nationwide banking data communication system experienced some issues, leading to a change in the response plan for processed transfers by the National Bank Fund Transfer Network (Zengin Net). They initially announced that transfers would be received on the same day, but later revised it to 'transfer processing in progress' due to the high volume of transactions.

In other news, 'Hasegawa O-Butsudan' has released a display shelf called 'Oshi-dan' (meaning 'supporter altar') for fans to showcase their favorite figures and accessories. Priced at 13,750 yen, it provides a sacred space for prayer and admiration.

Let's move on to technology updates. The new macOS 'Sonoma' was released on September 27th, and one of its notable features is the ability to place widgets anywhere on the desktop, similar to iOS. However, for those who have been using computers for a long time, the introduction of 'widgets on the desktop' may not seem like a groundbreaking feature. I'll explain the reasons behind this sentiment along with a brief history of macOS.

In the corporate world, Mitsui Fudosan has been utilizing AI-generated internal chat tool '&Chat' since August. With approximately 2,500 employees, they use this tool for idea generation and summarizing texts.

Lastly, let's talk about Pfizer's choice of using virtual reality (VR) for training staff in vaccine production. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has been investing heavily in the MR/VR field. While VR is often associated with entertainment, it is also being adopted for corporate use. Maika Collins, the Product Head of 'Meta for Work' at Meta Platforms, will share the latest examples of MR/VR applications.

That's all for today's news. Stay tuned for more updates from TotemoTech.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
