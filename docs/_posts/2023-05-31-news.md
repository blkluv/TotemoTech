### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on May 31st, 2023. JR East, West Japan, and Kyushu announced that they will raise the Shinkansen fares for online reservations from autumn due to the introduction of new services. FCNT, the company that produces the 'arrows' and 'rakuraku smartphone' series, has started civil rehabilitation proceedings, and users are concerned about whether they will continue to receive support from the four major mobile carriers. Esenergy announced a new service called 'Tada Den,' which provides free electricity up to 10,000 yen per month. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism apologized for the leakage of registration information for the 'Lava Dome Information Distribution System,' which included plain text passwords. Nature Remo, a smart remote control, has reduced the price of four models and aims to support households with energy management.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
