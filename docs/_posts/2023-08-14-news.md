### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on August 14th, 2023. The Perseus meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers, is set to peak tonight. However, due to the influence of Typhoon 7, it may be difficult to observe. Weather News suggests that the best chance for observation was on the 12th. In other news, a new Nintendo Switch game called 'Natsu Mon!' is gaining popularity as it allows players to experience the summer vacation of a rural town. Created by manga artist Kazu Ayabe, the game offers a unique perspective on summer vacations. Moving on to the tech industry, 'Vertical SaaS' is seeing growth in markets with limited IT budgets. We explore the reasons behind its success through interviews with vendors. Additionally, a new type of earphone called 'Cartilage Conduction' is gaining attention. Unlike traditional earphones, this type does not block the ears and is even suitable for use while sleeping. Finally, a paper titled 'Why Are We Always Chasing Deadlines?' by Professor Toyotaro Matsuo of the University of Tokyo, published in 2006, has become a hot topic on X (formerly Twitter). The paper discusses the constant struggle with deadlines and was written during Professor Matsuo's time as a researcher at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology. These are the top stories for today. Stay tuned for more news from TotemoTech.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
