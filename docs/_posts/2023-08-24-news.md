Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on August 24th, 2023. In today's news, concerns are growing over China's cyber attacks, with the US accusing Chinese hacker groups of targeting government agencies and networks. In July, unauthorized access to email accounts of the US State Department and other organizations was discovered, and in August, reports emerged of unauthorized intrusion into Japan's confidential defense network. Both incidents are believed to involve Chinese hackers, leading to increased vigilance by the US government and others.

Moving on to gaming news, PlayStation has announced its first remote play device, the PlayStation Portal Remote Player. This device is designed exclusively for the PS5 and is set to be released later this year. Pre-orders will begin soon, with a price tag of 29,980 yen.

In other news, KDDI has introduced a new plan called the 'au Money Activity Plan,' which combines mobile phone plans with financial services. This plan offers unlimited data usage and various benefits such as balance refunds through au PAY, preferential interest rates, and investment trust benefits.

In the tech world, the release of the 'Kiroku' app, which allows users to record their consent for sexual intercourse, has been postponed. The developers have announced that the app will be delayed to strengthen its security and add features to address concerns about potential coercion.

On the topic of data breaches, a former part-time employee at Meikai University has been found to have taken documents containing students' personal information. The employee used the documents for personal purposes, storing some and losing others in a restaurant. The university is investigating the incident.

In mobile service news, SoftBank has announced the launch of the new 'Simple 2' plans for its subsidiary, Y!mobile, starting in October. The existing 'Simple S/M/L' plans will be discontinued.

And finally, NTT Docomo has introduced the 'Anytime Kaedoki Program+' starting on September 1st. This program allows customers to upgrade to the latest smartphone every year by returning their current device, with the remaining balance being waived under certain conditions.
