Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on January 25th, 2024. In today's news, researchers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Marshall University have announced their findings on the mechanism that allows tardigrades, also known as water bears, to survive in extreme conditions. These tiny creatures employ a state of deep sleep called 'anhydrobiosis' to endure harsh environments. This discovery could have implications for various fields, including space exploration and cryopreservation.

Moving on to our next story, researchers from the University of California, Irvine, Florida University, Toyota InfoTech Labs, and the University of Electro-Communications have proposed a novel attack on autonomous vehicles. By using infrared lasers to shine spotlights on traffic signs, they can deceive the recognition systems of self-driving cars, leading to potential safety concerns. This research highlights the need for robust security measures in autonomous vehicle technology.

In other news, an animated film titled 'A Few Minutes of Encouragement,' produced mainly using Blender, is set to be released nationwide in early summer 2024. The film is a collaboration between the visual production units 'Hurray!' and '100studio,' with the script written by Juki Hanada, known for his work on 'A Place Further than the Universe.' This project showcases the versatility and capabilities of Blender as a powerful tool in the animation industry.

Moving on to the world of merchandise, Casetagram Limited, a Hong Kong-based company specializing in smartphone accessories, has announced a collaboration with the popular manga series 'Jujutsu Kaisen.' They will be releasing AirPods Pro cases inspired by the significant item 'Gokumon Kaikan' from the manga. Fans of the series can now showcase their love for the story while protecting their AirPods.

Shifting gears, NaviTime Japan has recently introduced the 'Hinata Route' on their walking app 'ALKOO by NAVITIME' and the comprehensive navigation app 'NAVITIME.' Following the success of the 'Shadow Map' and 'Shadow Route' features, the 'Hinata Route' provides users with directions that prioritize walking in sunny areas, allowing them to enjoy a more pleasant stroll.

In e-commerce news, Mercari, a popular online marketplace, has announced a ban on the sale of rare animals such as cockroaches and centipedes. Starting from February 13th, the listing and selling of these seven species will be prohibited. This decision aims to prevent the exploitation and trade of exotic creatures, ensuring the well-being and conservation of these species.

Lastly, Sakura Internet has revealed their upcoming cloud service called 'High Power' specifically designed for AI generation. This cloud service, equipped with the powerful 'NVIDIA H100,' will be available starting January 31st. It aims to provide the necessary computational resources for AI researchers and developers, enabling them to tackle complex tasks more efficiently and effectively.
