Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 22nd, 2023. In today's news, we have two exciting stories to cover.

First up, Blackmagic Design has officially released DaVinci Resolve 18.5, a video editing software. Originally announced in April, the software was made available as a beta version, allowing users to provide feedback on the new features. DaVinci Resolve 18.5 offers a wide range of new functions, including text-based video editing and automatic transcription. The software is priced at 42,980 yen, but a free version with limited features is also available.

Moving on to our second story, Pokémon GO enthusiasts are in for a treat with a new event called 'Fukanohi.' The event, which will take place from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. today, features special bonuses and surprises. One of the highlights is the chance to hatch Riolu, a rare Pokémon, from 2 km eggs instead of the usual 10 km eggs. Additionally, players may encounter shiny versions of Pokémon during the event.

That's all for today's news. Stay tuned for more updates from the world of technology.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
