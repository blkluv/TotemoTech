### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on October 26th, 2023. In today's news, we have two significant stories to cover.

First, let's talk about the new release from HHKB, the popular keyboard brand. The latest model, called HHKB Studio, has sparked some disappointment among fans on social media. You see, HHKB keyboards are known for their unique feature of using electrostatic capacitive switches made by Topre. However, the HHKB Studio deviates from this tradition and adopts linear mechanical switches instead. Many people wonder why PFU, the company behind HHKB, made this switch choice. We reached out to the company for an explanation, and they stated that they wanted to explore different switch options to cater to a wider range of users. While some fans may be disappointed, PFU believes that the new switch type offers a unique typing experience.

Moving on to our second story, the Japan Network Security Association recently conducted a survey to determine the financial damages faced by companies that have fallen victim to cyber attacks. The survey reached out to 70 companies that have experienced cyber attacks in the past. The results were quite revealing. The association found that the financial losses incurred by these companies varied greatly. While some companies reported minimal damages, others faced significant financial setbacks. This survey sheds light on the real-world impact of cyber attacks on businesses and emphasizes the importance of robust cybersecurity measures.
