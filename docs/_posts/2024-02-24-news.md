### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on February 24th, 2024. In today's news, the CP+2024 camera exhibition has opened, showcasing the latest trends in digital cameras. One of the highlights of the event is the emergence of compact and lightweight interchangeable lenses. These new lenses offer impressive specifications in a small and lightweight form factor.

In other news, Oisix La Grande, a Japanese food delivery service, announced the resignation of Chairman Kazuyoshi Fujita. The decision came after his inappropriate remarks on a social media platform. As a result, President Takaaki Takashima has voluntarily returned a portion of his compensation as a gesture of accountability.

Moving on, Izumi, a supermarket chain in Hiroshima, fell victim to a ransomware attack on its internal systems. The attack has disrupted the company's operations, with a full recovery not expected until May. As a result, delivery services and certain in-store promotions have been temporarily suspended. Alternative communication methods such as phone calls, faxes, and mail are being used.

In an effort to foster innovation and promote digital transformation and decarbonization, Kanagawa Prefecture has launched a program to recruit companies that want to collaborate with venture businesses and create new ventures. The initiative, called 'Open Innovation,' aims to facilitate the exchange of external talent and ideas to drive innovation. Financial assistance will also be considered for projects related to digital transformation and decarbonization.

At the CP+2024 exhibition in Yokohama, Fujifilm unveiled the X100VI 90th Anniversary Limited Edition, a special edition camera commemorating the company's 90th anniversary. Alongside the new model, the booth also featured a display showcasing the evolution of the X100 series cameras over the years.

And finally, in a lighthearted Easter egg for cat lovers, Google has added a special feature to its search service. When users search for keywords like 'cat' or 'Cat Day' and click on a button, a paw will appear on the screen, allowing users to stamp cute cat pawprints in their browser.

That's all for today's news. Thank you for tuning in to TotemoTech. Stay tuned for more updates on the latest tech developments.   Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
