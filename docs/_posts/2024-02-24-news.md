### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on February 24th, 2024. The CP+2024 camera show has kicked off, and one of the highlights is the emergence of compact and lightweight interchangeable lenses. These new products are impressively small and lightweight compared to their specifications. Moving on to our next story, Oisix La Grande, a food delivery service, announced the resignation of Chairman Kazuyoshi Fujita due to inappropriate remarks made on the X platform. President Takashima will also voluntarily return a portion of his compensation. In other news, Izumi, a supermarket chain, fell victim to a ransomware attack, causing a disruption in their internal systems. The recovery is expected to be completed by May, and in the meantime, communication is limited to phone calls, faxes, and mail. Shifting gears, Kanagawa Prefecture is seeking companies that are eager to collaborate with venture businesses to create new ventures. This initiative aims to support open innovation by fostering collaboration with external talent. Financial assistance is also being considered for projects related to digital transformation and decarbonization. On the photography front, the CP+2024 event showcased the newly announced X100 VI, which received great attention. Additionally, Fujifilm presented the X100VI 90th Anniversary Limited Edition, commemorating the company's 90th anniversary. Lastly, Google has a special treat for cat lovers. When you search for 'cat' or 'Cat Day' on their search service and click a button, a cat's paw will appear in your browser, leaving cute paw prints as a stamp of approval.
