### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on July 21st, 2023. In our first story, researchers from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and other institutions have published a study investigating the potential of large language models (LLMs) to collaborate with other LLM agents and humans in performing complex tasks. They explored whether LLMs can contribute to the development of cooperative agents capable of working together with humans.

Moving on to our next story, researchers from Microsoft and the Hong Kong Baptist University have proposed a method to enhance the Code LLM called 'StarCoder,' which was introduced by Hugging Face in May. Their approach aims to make StarCoder lightweight, while maintaining high accuracy in generating high-quality code from text.

Now let's talk about Kagome's behind-the-scenes efforts in their company-wide digital transformation (DX). They managed to involve everyone from the frontlines to the management team. One key factor behind their success was the belief that IT departments should not hinder progress.

In other news, Sony Group's design department has created prototypes with the theme '2050.' These prototypes were developed using a futuristic approach, and the designers aimed to explore the significance of envisioning the future.

Lastly, Netflix has started sending emails to its users in Japan who share their accounts with separate households, encouraging them to use the service within the same household. This follows the company's announcement to prohibit account sharing between households in the United States and other countries. The new policy will be implemented in Japan starting from the 20th of July.

That's all for today's news. Stay tuned for more updates on the latest tech developments.   And that's all for today's news. Thanks for listening to TotemoTech.
