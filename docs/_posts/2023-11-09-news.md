Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on November 9th, 2023. In today's news, Sharp, the Japanese electronics company, is currently experiencing a cloud service outage that is affecting the functionality of its home appliances. Since around 4 PM on November 9th, the company's cloud service has been unstable, causing connected features of Sharp appliances to malfunction. The official website of Sharp is also experiencing connectivity issues. Sharp has acknowledged the situation, stating that there is an unstable connection to the cloud service.

Moving on to our next story, LINE, the popular messaging app, has introduced a new AI summarization feature for its 'LINE Open Chat' function. This feature automatically summarizes the messages exchanged in chat rooms using AI technology provided by OpenAI's API. Users can now receive concise summaries of their conversations, making it easier to catch up on discussions.

In other news, Bing Chat, the chat AI function integrated into Microsoft's search engine 'Bing,' has announced that it is powered by the cloud service 'Oracle Cloud Infrastructure' (OCI) provided by Oracle. Bing Chat operates by utilizing a combination of Microsoft's cloud service 'Microsoft Azure' and OCI. This collaboration between Microsoft and Oracle enhances the capabilities of Bing Chat and improves its performance.

Moving on to the world of smartphones, Samsung Electronics has announced the development of its own generative AI called 'Samsung Gauss.' According to reports, Samsung plans to incorporate this AI technology into its upcoming 'Galaxy S24' series, which is expected to be released in the first half of 2024. The Samsung Gauss AI aims to enhance various features and functionalities of Galaxy devices.

In the field of computing, Fujitsu has introduced a groundbreaking technology called 'Adaptive GPU Allocator.' This technology allows for real-time switching between CPU and GPU processing, optimizing the overall processing efficiency. By dynamically allocating GPU resources to high-priority tasks, Fujitsu's Adaptive GPU Allocator significantly improves the performance of programs that require GPU acceleration.

Shifting gears to the realm of events, the organizers of Winter Comiket, one of Japan's largest comic conventions, have announced changes to their ticket pricing system. For the upcoming 'Comiket 103,' on-the-day tickets will be sold at double the regular price. This decision comes in response to the long queues and overcrowding issues experienced during the previous event. The organizers believe that this pricing adjustment will help manage the crowd and improve the overall experience.

Lastly, Toppan, a leading printing company, has successfully reduced system development time by up to 70% through the utilization of generative AI. By implementing their internally developed LLM (Language and Logic Model) for program development, Toppan has achieved significant time savings in tasks such as code summarization and code generation. This innovative approach has proven to be highly efficient, streamlining the company's programming workflow.
