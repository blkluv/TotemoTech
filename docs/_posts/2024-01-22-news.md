### Transcript

Hello and welcome to today's news from TotemoTech on January 22nd, 2024. In today's news, we have two significant stories to cover.

First, the official account of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been hacked, leading to the spread of false information. This incident raises concerns about the prevalence of account takeovers and cryptocurrency scams. It's unclear who is behind these attacks, but it's a reminder of the importance of implementing robust security measures to prevent such incidents.

Moving on to our second story, a new smartphone game called 'Casual Fight' has recently been released by HUP Games in South Korea. This game has caused frustration among gamers, including well-known manga artist who is a fan of 'kuso-ge' (infamously bad games). The game's developer, previously known for the legendary 'Final Sword', seems to have created a game that is equally frustrating and challenging. The unexpected release of 'Casual Fight' has caught the attention of gamers and has become a topic of discussion within the gaming community.

That's all for today's news. Stay tuned for more updates from TotemoTech.   Visit JapanDailyNews.com for the news, yen exchange rates, and a daily Japanese proverb.
