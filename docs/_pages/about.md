### What is this?

Encouraged by friends in the [Tokyo Tech](https://tokyotech.com) community, this podcast uses AI to generate natural English summaries of Japanese tech news stories, which are then converted into human-sounding speech. The result is short, easy-to-digest English tech news updates that are directly from a Japanese source.

Simiarly, I also made a site and podcast providing [general news from Japan (Japan Daily News)](https://japandailynews.com).
