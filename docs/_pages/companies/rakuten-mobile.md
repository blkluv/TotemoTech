summary: "Rakuten Mobile, Inc. is a Japanese mobile network operator (MNO) that provides mobile phone services. As a part of the Rakuten Group, it is the fourth-largest telecommunications company in Japan, following NTT DoCoMo, KDDI, and Softbank. Rakuten also operates 'Rakuten Mobile', a virtual MNO (MVNO) business that was operated by Rakuten Group before being integrated into the Rakuten Mobile network in April 2019. Rakuten Mobile received the allocation of 1.7GHz band from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications Radiation Council on April 6, 2018, securing its participation in MNO. Although the service was supposed to be launched on October 1, 2019, network construction delays resulted in trial operations. The service launch in Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, and Kobe, which are the service areas, was postponed until spring 2020. On March 3, 2020, Rakuten Mobile announced that it would start MNO services with a single plan on April 8, 2020. As a temporary measure until the network is complete, the company provides services using au communication network roaming services outside its service area. Rakuten also announced that it would end new MVNO service subscriptions as of April 7, 2020."
