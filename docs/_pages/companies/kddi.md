summary: "KDDI Corporation, also known as 'au', is a major telecommunications company in Japan that specializes in mobile phone services. The company was formed in 2000 through the merger of DDI, KDD, and IDO. It became known as KDDI Corporation in 2002. KDDI's predecessor, KDD, was a special company established in 1953 by the former Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation for the development of international communication networks. While KDDI was initially recognized as the largest rival of NTT and NCC, it has faced strong competition from SoftBank Group's M&A strategy and contract cancellations due to number portability since around 2013. KDDI is a component stock of the Nikkei Average Stock Price Index, TOPIX Core30, and JPX Nikkei Index 400. The company's slogan is 'Tomorrow, Together' as of May 15, 2019."
