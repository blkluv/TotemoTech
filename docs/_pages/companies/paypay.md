summary: "PayPay Corporation is a Japanese fintech corporation that provides the country's largest QR code payment service, as well as financial services under the PayPay brand. It is a joint venture between SoftBank and Z Holdings, and a consolidated subsidiary of the latter. PayPay was established in 2018 to compete with the QR code payment solutions of Alipay and WeChat Pay, which saw explosive popularity in China. It is one of the pioneers of QR code payments in Japan, and has the highest usage rate among competing payment solutions such as Rakuten Pay and d Payment. PayPay began as a real payment entry strategy for Yahoo, which had already developed the largest online payment service in Japan. With the establishment of PayPay in June 2018, the company became the operating agency for its existing services such as payment of taxes and public utility charges with barcode readers, and payment of "Code Payments" where consumers present QR codes and pay in stores."
